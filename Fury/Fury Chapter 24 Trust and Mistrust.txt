Félix and eight friends were waiting at an intersection in their path. The weapons they were carrying would have sent a shiver down his spine if he still had one. Felix had a crystal shot, others had a smart dart gun, lightning spear gun, plus assorted slug throwers, lasers and masers. They were Heavy military rifles, not the small hand guns that most of his escort were carrying.

<Hello Naddy. Where are you going?> asked Félix.

Mark ran their IDs against Varija's files. She had dossiers on five of them. Four of them were known associates of the Jedwar. Three of them had served serious time in lockdown. All of them had dirt in their files and all of them had transferred in from other franchises within the last decade. Extortion, theft, gambling, dealing in illicit devices. 

<None of your business, and only my friends call me Naddy. Princess Valerie ordered you back to your quarters, why aren't you there?> asked Nadja.

Another group came into view behind them. They were out of range of Mark's ticks but closing. Mark counted six including one who was a known associate of the Jedwars.

<Been and gone darling. Been and gone.> sent Félix. <You shouldn't be taking the prisoner out of the secured area,> 

Mark stepped forward and to the side to get in a better position. Mark sent a targeting program and a firing sequence to Tânia and Tidir who had their heaviest non-lethal weapons. <Get ready,> he warned.

Tidir gave Mark a dirty look, before turning to Tânia. He noticed the now familiar signs that Tânia and Tidir were arguing privately. Meanwhile Nadja was still arguing with Félix. <The Princess has been given responsibility for the prisoner, not you, and not the Jedwar.> she sent.


<Things are going to turn nasty soon. You need to make a decision,> Mark warned Tânia and Tidir.

<I don't see the Princess here,> sent Félix continuing his argument with Nadja.

Tânia sent a revised targeting priorities list. Glancing quickly at those priorities, he noted that she rated two of the unknowns as far more dangerous that he had. 


<The princess left me in charge of the prisoner. I will secure him as I see fit.> returned Nadja to Félix.


<We are firing now!> announced Tânia, 


But Mark was already firing ticks from all three of his launchers targeting Félix, the smart dart gunman whose ID proclaimed her as Deirdre Ayers, and the Lightning Spear gunman, called Liliya Jo. He was firing his second volley at his next group of targets as Tânia was sending ’Now’.  <Get down!> He sent to Monika, Silvia and Irina. The last thing he needed was one of them to fire a lethal weapon.

It took 3.48 seconds for the missile's payload to lockdown a target. An eternity in a fire fight. Mark watched as a look of puzzlement then anger was displayed on Félix’s animated features. <You bitch!> he sent to Nadja. Only then did he start to raise his arm to fire the deadly crystal shot. Mark fired his third volley just as Félix started cursing Nadja. His tick launchers were starting to overheat. 

A tangle round from Tidir’s tangler wrapped itself around Félix before he could discharge the crystal shot. Félix threw himself backwards in an attempt to bring his weapon to bear. This would have worked, killing a number of Mark’s escort and possibly Mark himself at the cost of blowing off Félix’s own foot, however the lockdown took effect while he was in midair. He landed with a thud on the spongy floor, his joints locked into immobility.

Ayers was quicker she managed to fire a dart at Tânia, just as Tânia hit her with a tase grenade, a couple of dozen electrodes penetrated her skin, the single crystal needles dragging their superconducting threads behind them. The grenade’s SMES cell discharged, sending her limbs twitching uncontrollably as she collapsed. Before she could reset her circuit-breakers and recover, her body froze as the lockdown took hold. Tânia staggered but managed to complete her firing sequence.

Jo was still examining the discolored tick entry point, which the tick had sealed behind it, when several tase electrodes from the grenade meant for Ayers penetrated her arm and gave her a nasty shock. She had barely looked up and registered what was happening when she was hit by a tangle round. Before she could disentangle herself she was frozen into immobility.

Read and Sexton the men that Tânia had marked as dangerous were also quick to react. They both raised their guns, Read aimed at Tidir, but he was knocked off balance by Jo’s flailing as she endeavored to free herself, so that the slug hit Irina instead sending her tumbling backwards. Sexton shot Tânia with a laser, burning a diagonal score on her torso before the beam was interrupted by a tangle round. The partially cooked tangle slammed into Sexton entangling him. The damage Tânia suffered didn’t stop her body following the pre-programmed targeting sequence launching the next tase grenade at Read, which temporarily disabled him until the lockdown tarka paralysed him and shocked those on either side of him. 
Sexton managed to pull his arm free of the denatured tangle, but froze before he could shoot again. The final target of Mark’s second volley, Clarisse Ibbott, didn’t manage to fire a single shot before Tânia’s third grenade took her out. The targets of Mark’s third volley didn’t fare much better with only one of them getting off a shot which narrowly missed Tidir before they were taken down by tangle bolts and tase grenades.

<What the fuck? Tânia! We could’ve talked our way past them,> sent Nadja, rushing to examine Irina.

<No, we couldn’t. That was Tammaro Read and Homer Sexton,> replied Tânia. <How is Irina?>

Mark was grateful that Nadja hadn’t yet figured out that Mark had been involved in the takedown and that Tânia wasn’t in a hurry to enlighten her.

None of his escort had yet noticed the six armed men coming up behind them. 360 degree vision was an art, even if you had the visual sensors facing in all directions, there was only so much information that a human or even trans-humans like Mark and his 23rd century friends could process through their visual cortex. 

The six had picked up their pace once the firing had started and were about to come in range of his ticks. He faced his palms backwards, set the ticks to maximum stealth and fired his first two ticks.

<Who the hell are Read and Sexton?> asked Nadja as she examined Irina.

<They’re {i}Red Mars{/i}. High ranking {i}Red Mars{/i},> sent Tânia.

Mark was firing his second volley at the approaching enemy when Monika stepped forward and brought up her slug thrower in her right hand. Mark leapt to the side, his left hand shot out grabbing her gun hand. His right hand stayed pointing towards the encroaching enemy firing ticks at each pre-calculated target.

He tried twisting Monika’s gun and hand, the bang of the firing weapon resonated in his quills the vibrations traveling up his arm. He had not been quick enough, the gun had fired, the slug hitting Read, the man who had shot Irina. 

A maser appeared in Monika’s left hand and she pointed it at him. There was a struggle as she tried to force her gun hand down. She was very determined to put 2 or 3 more slugs into poor Mr. Read.

<Irina is fine. You don’t need to do this. Nadja tell her that Irina is fine,> 
pleaded Mark. Monika stopped struggling, but seemed to be intent on staring him down in a contest of wills. He didn’t need this. Only one of his three tick launchers was pointing in right direction to fire at the remaining enemies. He was out of position, Tomás only had to move slightly to block his field of fire completely and instead of focusing on the dangerous enemies he was distracted by this incident with Monika. 
He could only hope that as long as they thought they had the element of surprise, the second group of enemies would close the distance before opening fire. About half of Félix’s lot had realized they had been hit, therefore some of the rear attackers would probably feel the impacts. He only hoped that they would be confused about the source of the attack for the few needed seconds.

<Her brain-case wasn’t breached. If we get her to a mechanic before her life support fails she should be fine,> sent Nadja. <Monika, it isn’t worth being locked down by the Jeddak.>

Monica did not seem to be in a hurry to shoot Mark with the maser nor did she do the obvious and fire the maser at Read. By the time Mark fired the last tick his hand overheating badly. He started firing a second tick at each man. After the second man his launcher jammed, warped from the heat. <Are you going fire that maser or just wave it about?> Mark recklessly challenged Monika.

Tânia stiffened and started to swing her gun around, then stopped. The sneak attackers had halted, gathered around two, then three, then four of their number who had frozen. One them spun around, but froze mid turn. The last took a lurching step away, then there six frozen statues standing behind them. Tânia gave him a look and raised her eyebrows.

Nadja straightened from examining Irina and <This is not good, we just took down a bunch of security. The Princess and the Jeddak are going to vent steam,> sent Nadja.

<It was my decision. I'll take the heat, besides security aren't supposed to carry military level armament inside residential corridors and they are not supposed to be associating with {i}Red Mars{/i}. I don't think we're the ones that will be in trouble,> retorted Tânia.

<We opened fire without warning.>

<I opened fire and Tidir opened fire under my orders. We fired non-lethals. We couldn’t afford to let them fire first, bunched up the way we are, one blast from the crystal shot alone would have taken us all out.>

<What about?> Nadja jerked her head in Monika's direction.

<Fog of war. Understandable confusion and panic under fire.>

<No-one viewing the recording is going to buy that.>

<Let’s hope he doesn’t die then,> sent Tânia.

<You know you don’t want to shoot him again. It would be too deliberate, there has been too much time to think,> Mark sent to Monika.
 
<Fine, I probably already did in the shit-head anyway,> sent Monika turning to Mark she continued, <For a prisoner, you sure are a pushy bastard.> Monika put away her maser and Mark released her hand. They eyed each other for a moment before stepping away from each other. 

Nadja gave him a frosty look. <I can’t say she’s wrong. I don’t know whether to thank you or shoot you,> sent Nadja as she walked over to the man Monika shot. <You little shit! They’re all locked down. You shot them! You shot them all! I ought to … > sent Nadja.

<Don’t. Just be grateful that he came in on our side,> sent Tânia.

<He is supposed to be our prisoner. We are supposed to protect him. He’s not supposed to protect us.>

<Is he our prisoner? It seems to me that he could kill us anytime he wanted.>

Mark stood very still and made sure that his palms stayed pointing down.

<Even if he could get the drop on all seven of us, which I doubt, I still have the tase grenade stuck to his back slaved to a dead man’s switch,> argued Nadja.

<Just one tase grenade? Maybe you should think about using 5 or 10. Why didn’t you disarm him?>

<Disarming him is easier said than done. Even if I stripped him down to just life support, he will still probably be able to assemble a weapon.>

<Can we argue about this later?> suggested Tidir as put down her heavy auto cannon tangler and started collecting weapons from Félix’s group and placing them in one of the brightly colored bags Mark had seen at the university bazaar.

<We need to warn the ‘Rangs. {i}Red Mars {/i} might retaliate, or the Jedwar might cause problems, though I don’t think Félix was here in an official capacity. I’m calling in a code grey alert,> sent Tânia.

There was a crack from the sponge floor as Monica hoisted the unconscious Irina over her shoulder. Her feet sunk into the floor, the lighter gravity of Mars more than offset by the weight of two heavy bio-mech bodies. <Let’s get out of here before more of the Jedwar’s goons show up.>

<We need to call in the emergency mechanics,> sent Silvia. <How is Read?>

<His survival AI is identifying me as a hostile enemy. It won’t give me any information or allow me to help him,> said Nadja.

<Leave him to emergency services.>

<Who the hell are they?> asked Nadja spotting the six statues behind them for the first time.

<You just noticed them? They were sneaking up behind us while your friend Félix kept us distracted,> sent Tânia just as if she had seen them right from the start.

<Did Kiro …?> sent Nadja.

<Those missiles are really low profile, hard to detect. You have to reverse engineer those for us.> sent Tânia. <Why did you help us Kiro? You could have sat out the conflict or weighed in on the other side.>

<We Boomerangs have to stick together,> Mark sent. He felt the less said about the situation the better.

<That isn’t much of an answer,> sent Nadja.

<We need to hurry. Silvia, Tomás, grab the weapons from the rear group. Nadja check Tânia out. She took two hits during the firefight and she could be dying and you know she wouldn’t complain,> sent Tidir.

<{i}Mars defiant{/i}, I’m sorry Tânia, I didn’t think,> sent Nadja. She rushed over to Tânia removing tape from an inner compartment. <Put down that heavy auto-cannon. It’s a wonder your damaged infrastructure hasn't snapped under that load.> She examined the melted laser scoring across Tânia’s chest and the pink sealant foam that had oozed out of the cut. She wrapped the cut with tape. <You will need some serious time in the shop but I don’t think the laser hit anything vital.> 

<It’s not the laser damage that is the main worry. It’s the smart dart. It’s trying to hack into my systems.  I’m up to date with my patches and it isn’t using any new exploits so I am holding it off, but I am having trouble purging it from my frame,> sent Tânia.

Zooming in, Mark could see that the area around the entry wound was discolored and bulging outwards. Switching to infrared it shone brightly. It was hot.

<Why didn’t you tell us?> asked Nadja.

<I thought I could handle it. It will probably be fine, my tarka is holding it at bay.>

Nadja examined Tânia, then jerked back, stepping away from her. <I don’t think it’s going to be okay. I don’t think I can fix this.>
