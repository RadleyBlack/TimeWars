Ichigo helped Mark into the wheelchair. She then grabbed the dildo from the limo.

<Maybe we could play with this later,> she sent as she dropped the dildo, and some of its disposable capsules into her bag.

The wheelchair automatically followed her as she made a bee line to the lifts. <Where are we going?> he asked.

<I booked the penthouse,> she replied. <Are you hungry?>

<A little.>

<I have ordered food and I want you to eat as much as you can,> she insisted. <Your body is going through a lot of changes, and you are going to need the energy.> 

When they reached the lifts, the doors automatically opened. Ichigo did not need to select a floor, as the lift already seemed to know where they were going. When the lift opened, it revealed a vast open plan space, that covered the entire floor. Almost everything seemed to be made of glass. Defused soft lightning revealed tropical fish and sea life under the glass floor. The cityscape was visible through the glass walls, and the stars were visible through the glass ceiling. 

<How much of this is real?> 

<At these prices. Most of it. There are some screens hiding supports, plumbing, and the machinery of the apartment, but most of what you are seeing is real.> She led him to a low glass table that was covered with food. She helped him out of the wheelchair, and examined his arm and leg.

<The tarka has accelerated your healing, but you have a long way to go. Once your body has become saturated with tarka, the healing will proceed much more rapidly,> she commented.

The wheelchair trundled back to the lift as Mark took his seat at the table. The padding was comfortable, and a pit underneath the table held their legs. The plates were glass, and the cutlery was glass chopsticks. Mark watched the fish swim beneath his feet though the tabletop.

<I apologize for the food.  I had the hotel add the mineral supplements you need,> she said.

<I don't mind the taste. In fact my body seems to know that it needs the minerals.>

Mark selected a dumpling with his chopsticks, dipped it in one of the sauces, and placed it in his mouth. An overwhelming need flooded his senses, and suddenly he was stuffing dumplings in his mouth chewing, and swallowing as fast as he could.

<Whoa! Slow down! Also dipping them in a sauce can help with the metallic taste.> 

<Sorry, I just felt so hungry. Did you turn up the lights?> he asked.

<No, your night vision is getting better. I am going to connect you to the table. I want you to use the table’s interface to move the plates you want to obtain food from, so they are closer to you. I am going to stimulate the interface. Do you feel a tingling? Try to flex your muscles near that sensation,> she suggested.

The dishes started to move around the table. “Whoa, did I do that?” 

<Yes, you did. I want you to practice controlling the table during the meal. Consider it part of your training. Also practice sending instead of talking>

Mark noticed that Ichigo’s chopsticks seem to change shape on command. They elongated to spear an errant dumpling. 

<How did you do that?> he asked.

<Master using the table and I will show you how to use the chopsticks.>

The food disappeared quickly as both Mark and Ichigo were hungry. Mark mastered the table, and then managed to learn how to manipulate the chopsticks. Ichigo then showed him how to access the drinks menu and order a drink. He ordered a coffee.

<You know the caffeine won’t affect you? It will be removed from your system just like any other drug,> she reminded him.

<I really need to go,> he stated.

<Follow the glowing footsteps.>

<Could you also turn down the lights? It is getting bright in here.> It seemed as bright as day now. He could now see the small distortions that marked where video screen hid the supports, plumbing, and the machinery that Ichigo mentioned before.

<I will turn them off. Your eyesight has improved to the extent that the light pollution from the city should be enough to light your way,> she sent.

After he returned he started to page though the menu system he found what he thought was a movie catalog. On a whim he requested Fellowship of the Ring and asked it to start midway though. He found himself in a forest near a river a large willow on its bank. A hobbit seemed to be drowning in the river. Mark reached down grabbed the hobbit by the back of the jacket, and pulled him out of the river. The hobbit coughed and spluttered then said something unintelligible. Text appeared in front of him and the hobbit looked at him expectantly. He spoke the nonsense words in front of him and the hobbit responded with more gibberish. The forest disappeared and he found himself beside Ichigo again.

<Did you mean to plug yourself into an immersive? Because it is hard to eat your food or to talk to your dinner companions if you do that,> she sent.

<No, I wanted to see what a 23rd Century entertainment was like, but I got a little more than I bargained for. Thank you for pulling me out of there.>

<These entertainments come with an assortment of interaction modes. The least interactive mode is rail screener mode. Do you want me to set it to that?> she asked.

<Yes, but no sound.>

Window to a 3D world appear at the end of the table. Merry and Pippin where imprisoned by Old Man Willow, and Frodo and Sam were trying to free them, by burning down the willow. It definitely was not the Peter Jackson version.

He finished the meal off with a delicious coconut ice-cream confection. <I think I am full. Did you mention something about a spa?> he asked.

<That I did.  Let’s have quick shower then a soak,> she sent, switching off the movie and helping him up. <I want you to try to access the shower controls.> 

Water started falling from the ceiling. <You are getting better at this.> She smiled at him and he lent in to kiss her. Her lips were plump and soft tasting of strawberries, and her naked body pressed against his. She wrapped her arms around him with surprising strength one hand behind his head and the other squeezing his butt. Mark had to make do with one hand on her soft but firm ass. He felt her hard nipples pressing into his chest. She fondled his balls and cock.

<Perhaps we should take this to the spa,> she sent looking flushed. She switch off the shower.
