Chapter 27 : Retrieval

{b}Location{/b} : West of Vienna, Austria{br}
{b}Era{/b} : Thursday 13 May 1790CE {br}

The smoke from the burning farmhouse carried the sickening smell of burnt meat.

“Those poor people. Can’t we do something?” asked Irmhild.

“If we jumped back and gave them high level tarka then sent in a snatch team at just the right time,” suggested Ranjeet uncertainly.

“Even then it would be - challenging,” said Alec sadly.

<I have an idea. Why don’t I just rip the bastard's head off?> sent Lieutenant Ellen Sarkozi launching herself forward out of the cover of the forest towards the horseman who was responsible for the devastation in front of them.

<“No, don’t,”> communicated Alec and Varija in unison. Acting as one, they each grabbed one of Ellen’s shoulders and hauled her back.

<“You can’t change the past,”> the Furies explained simultaneously, then looked at each other in annoyance.

“He has to meet me in Vienna in a year,” elaborated Alec, “otherwise we would not have even known to be here.”

They had arrived at the time and place the captured time criminal had confessed to last seeing his spacecraft. The farmhouse had been already ablaze and the younger version of Adonis Como had been finishing off his last victim, a mature woman, who was solid but short. The victim’s body lay like an accusation just outside the doorway of her former home.

They had all been upset, but Ellen in particular seemed to have difficulty controlling her rage. They had barely managed to drag her to the cover of nearby trees before Como had finished with what he was doing and turned in their direction.

Ellen had already been angry and frustrated over Varija’s refusal to hear the report on her three week mission to Mars. Varija had picked her up at their prearranged rendezvous and told her that debriefing could wait and that 2299 was not going anywhere.

While witnessing Como’s atrocities sent the others into shock, horror and nausea, Ellen was consumed by righteous indignation and an almost physical need to inflict retribution on Como.

<What about all the other people he is going to torture, rape and murder between now and when you capture him?> Ellen said.

Alec and Varija glanced unhappily at each other, neither had a good answer to that.

<If I go out there to kill him, what could possibly stop me?> asked Ellen.

<”I don’t know,”> the clones answered. <And that should scare you,> continued Varija.

<Not everyone has your obsessive need to plan everything or the need to determine the outcome before making the first move,> argued Ellen.

<”Don’t dismiss my caution,”> Alec and Varija answered. “Most of our enemies are either, in prison, dead, or their careers are in ruins,” said Alec. 

<It was bad enough when there was only one of you. What did I do to deserve this?” asked Ellen.

“Whatever you do will he turn up alive in Vienna and cause enough death and destruction that I will notice him,” explained Alec. <You might suffer a stroke before you can strike him down,> suggested Varija. “He might spin around and shoot you,” offered Alec. <You might kill him, but afterwards someone puts him back together and sends him on his way,> sent Varija. “Whatever happens, nothing will have changed,” concluded Alec.

Ellen lowered her eyes, her shoulders slumped in defeat.

After concluding his business Como had wandered over to where a rather ugly looking horse was tied up on a railing. He untied the horse and mounted. He guided the horse down a track that led away from their hidden observation spot.

“How did you manage to capture him?” Mark asked Alec.

“I dumped him in a hole and threatened to bury him alive if he didn’t give me administration access to his tarka,” replied Alec.

When Como disappeared from view they emerged from their hiding place and walked towards a very peculiar building.

<I can’t understand how he thought this would fool anyone?> commented Varija.

Como had said he had left the spacecraft in a barn, however the strange edifice looked more like someone had completely covered a spaceship with random pieces of wood.

“He isn’t very bright,” noted Alec.

<He was bright enough to break the security on this ship,> rejoined Varija. <Maybe he never intended to return to his ship?>

“You guys should talk. Your disguises aren’t going to fool anyone either,” said Irmhild.

Varija and her team: Mark, Professor Jordán and Ellen were still in their bio-mech bodies, disguised only by long shapeless, hooded robes.

Alec and her team: Irmhild and Ranjeet were in organic bodies and period clothes. Aside from being almost supernaturally good looking compared to the average 18th century native they could almost have fit in.

<Blame my impatience to get my hands on the spacecraft,> replied Varija. She transmitted the authorization code that they had obtained from their captive and the door slid open to reveal an airlock. The airlock opened into a corridor decorated late 23rd century style with an animated forest displayed on walls, floor and ceiling. They turned left and headed toward the nose of the craft. The cockpit sported eight chairs but no controls, the crew was expected to control the ship through their tarka.

Alec and Varija sat down and closed their eyes. They opened their eyes in astonishment. “Buddha on a stick.” exclaimed Alec.

<Language! Alec,> admonished Varija.

<“This ship is amazing”> they exclaimed at the same time. They looked at each other in annoyance. <“Stop doing that.”> They asked each other.

<This is a 300 year old decommissioned warship, named {i}Kathryn’s Joy{/i}. Kiro and Jordán plug in to the ships system and start analyzing these specs> sent Varija. 

<It has 4 C-S particles regulating a micro fusion reactor that is a hundred times smaller than any reactor I have seen,> remarked Jordán.

<There are logs detailing battles on Earth at New Atlantis in 2164, and in several other star systems.> observed Mark.

“Battle against enemies with names like the Orion Hegemony, the Terran Federation, the Principality of Heaven,” read Alec.

<Apparently Heaven is in the Perseus Arm,> joked Varija.

“Who knew?” asked Alec with a smile.

<This ship has seen a lot of action. The front of the ship was sliced off in one battle and the human crew has been killed twice.>

“The weapon schematics are still in the system; we could re-arm the ship,” said Alec.

<Trust you to find the weapons.>

“Don’t get snarky at me.”

<Just saying,> sent Varija.

“Then say less.”

<“We need to go before the neighbors investigate the smoke,”> they stated simultaneously. “Everyone secure themselves in a chair,” continued Alec.

Mark had no sooner activated the webbing on his chair than he was jerked backward by the jump.

<“We are still in 1790,”> they said together. <But we are now at the future site of Utopia.> continued Varija. “The capital of New Atlantis.” Alec added.

The external feeds were now showing the white snowscape of the TransAntarctic Mountains.

<Listening to the two of you is getting seriously creepy.> sent Ellen.

<“Two of us!”> they exclaimed. <We are not fungible units.> Varija added. “We are individuals,” added Alec.

Ellen looked at Alec then at Varija, who both had very similar expressions and body language despite one being organic human and the other bio-mech. <Right,> she sent.

“Just because you’re sleeping with my sister, doesn’t mean you can get snarky.” warned Alec.

<Alec, please,> requested Varija.

<Ellen’s asking if Alec being part of the team is going to be a long term thing.> sent Mark trying to smooth things over.

Alec eyes narrowed. <“No!”> they both said. “We don’t get along,” added Alec. <We did once,> contradicted Varija.”Not since Defcon 2293.” <You still haven’t forgiven me for that.>

<That was the Defcon where you were recognized as a Mage under the name {i}The Fury{/i}.> sent Ellen.

“Wasn’t there some kind of terrorist attack?” asked Ranjeet.

<When it’s a government behind it they are usually called death squads.> stated Varija furiously.

“Was that the one in the Aksumite Empire? It was Tatienne Arden City, wasn’t it?” asked Irmhild.

“That’s the one. The Head Fox of the Maenads, Thórhildr Bellamy tried to accept the award in our name. I came as Thomas Helrich, our other sister Meg came as Carine Ford, and Tis was providing over watch.  For some stupid reason we thought it was important to prove that Thomas and Carine were different people. It didn’t make any difference. Everyone was still convinced that they were both me, even when they had seen them both in the same place talking to each other,” rambled Alec.

“Are you called {i}The Fury{/i} because there are three of you? There are only three, right?” asked Irmhild.

<No, it’s because of that stupid photo taken when I was 16. I was known as {i}The Fury{/i} way before 2293,> sent Varija.

“You were supposed to protect us, Tis” accused Alec.

<There were eight death squads with six men each and in the end it was your boyfriend who took you down.>

“It was {b}our{/b} boyfriend and they had his sister and parents hostage. In the end he paid for trusting them.” muttered Alec.

Varija turned away and they fell silent.

“Do you feel like discussing what happened to your boy-“ Irmhild’s question was interrupted by Ranjeet clapping a hand over her mouth. 

“It’s clear that they don’t want to discuss it,” he said. 

<Perma-death,> sent Varija.

“Someone wiped his backup,” Alec whispered.

<We should never have let Thórhildr accept the award.>

“She was high profile, they probably would have gone after her anyway.”

<So many people killed just to get to us,> Varija sent sadly.

“The news sites said only three people died,” said Irmhild.

“There were only three people who suffered Perma-death. That was their excuse. {i}Oh you were all backed up anyway.{/i} Like death doesn’t matter when you can clone a copy to replace the person who has been lost.” Alec was openly crying now.

<643 people died that day. More died after.>

“That’s what happens when you fire antipersonnel missiles and high-explosive incendiaries inside a crowded building, there is a limit to what even Survival Tarka can protect you from,” said Alec as she wiped her eyes.

“That’s not how it was reported,” said Ranjeet.

<Way to go, bringing the room down, guys,> sent Jordán.  

<Can we stop poking at raw wounds? It’s clear that this is a traumatic tropic for the Kunasadas,> sent Mark.

<“We don’t mind,”> they said. 

<The fuck you don’t,> asserted Mark.

<Language, Kiro.> No matter how upset, Varija never forgot Mark’s current alias, or her own. After an uncomfortable pause she continued, <I don’t know how they thought they could get away with it? Why they thought the Grey Hats wouldn’t retaliate?> 

“Poor Peter wasn’t the only one Perma-deathed,” Alec said with satisfaction.

<You shouldn’t have given {i}Sanity{/i} that list.>

“I told everyone, who was responsible for the massacre, not just {i}Sanity{/i}. The victims had a right to justice.>

<Justice, or retribution? You contributed to those NAIA agents and those NAC senators' deaths,> sent Varija.

“{i}Sanity{/i} would have found out anyway. Especially with {i}The Cannon{/i} siding with them. Besides you’re always arguing for transparency. Let sunlight and fresh air remove the rot. Isn’t that what you say?”

<How long have we been fighting corruption and abuse of power? No matter how many of them we jail or ruin, more come out of the woodwork.>

“Is that why you ran off to Mars?” asked Alec.

“Let’s talk about something else,” Mark suggested.

“Wait! {i}The Cannon{/i} was involved in those deaths in NAIA and its oversight committee in 2294? I thought he worked for the NAIA,” asked Ranjeet.

<“They, not he,”> they answered. <{i}The Cannon{/i} is a team the same as {i}The Dragon{/i},> sent Varija. “{i}Sanity{/i} was formed in response to the Tatienne Arden City Massacre, half the cybersecurity community joined including {i}The American Cannon{/i} and {i}The Chinese Dragon{/i},” said Alec. <{i}Cannon{/i} and {i}Dragon{/i} finally found someone that they hated more than each other,> sent Varija.

<Ranjeet you’re not helping. Why don’t we talk about this nice shiny spaceship we’ve just found?> asked Mark.

<It’s 300 years old and it smells a little funny,> corrected Varija. There was a long awkward silence where Alec and Varija avoided looking at each other.

Alec’s eyes narrowed with suspicion, “Tis, who is Kiro, really? He feels familiar.”

<He’s just a physics wonk,>

“Like Unka Dar?” asked Alec. “I know you are hiding something. I know you too well. Kiro, do you have something to say for yourself.”

“I am just someone who cares,” responded Mark.

“Someone who cares. Tis remember whenever we had a fight with Channy, Unka Dar would always make us stop and apologise to each other, he said it didn’t matter who started the fight, it was both of our responsibilities to take care of each other,” asked Alec.

<I don’t think we counted as a ‘we’ at that point.>

“We definitely count as a ‘we’ now. Tis why do you have be so anal?”

<Because you are,> sent Varija.

“I don’t think I was ever {b}that{/b} anal.”

<{i}Earth fell and Mars starved{/i}. Could you two please stop?> sent Ellen in frustration. There was another awkward silence.

Finally Varija lowered her head and communicated with Mark privately. <I have a choice. I could cannibalise this ship for the C-S particles and give four team members the ability to travel in time, or if there is another source of C-S particles I could equip the team with time travel plus build more ships. Tell me about your ideas about getting more C-S particles.>

<Idea One. We create a time loop. The C-S particle is passed from person to person so that it loops around multiple times until it get back to the original donor. There is still only one particle but everybody gets a turn,> sent Mark.

<So everybody meets themselves?>

<Maybe. You could probably arrange it so they didn’t. Person A gives the particle to the younger version of Person B, older B gives it to younger C, older C gives it to A just after they have given it up.>

<No, I don’t think so. What’s idea two?> asked Varija.

<According to the most widely accepted theories C-S particles hit the Earth all the time and some of those particles should get trapped in magnetite deposits. These particles should be detectable through their gravitational anomalies, not to mention that people would randomly disappear during thunderstorms if they stood near magnetite,>

<Yes, but no-one’s been able to find them in magnetite.>

<What if that’s because time travelers went back in time and harvested them?> suggested Mark.

<That is the craziest idea I have ever heard.>

<But it is easily testable.>

<We would just have to go back into prehistory and if there are a bunch of gravitational anomalies, then our problems are solved ,and if there are no anomalies, then we haven’t lost anything by checking,> sent Varija.

<Correct.>

<We need to get rid of Alec.>

<Why?> asked Mark.

<She already thinks of Darren every time she looks at you and she told us that Darren figured out how to get more C-S particles. If we get more C-S particles while she is here she is going to take one look at you and she will know, that is if she doesn’t know already,> Varija sent privately. 

<Why don’t you want Alec to know about me?> asked Mark.

<We aren’t as close as we used to be,> confessed Varija. <She is going to go her own way. Ten to one she will end up in charge of one of those star empires mention in the log and I end up in charge of another.> 
<Alec you need to go back to our future. Give this token to Ellen and she will let you into the meeting.> she continued publicly.

“Is this because we fought?” Alec asked.

<No, it’s because it’s time.>

“By the way, Vienna’s graveyards are going to start filling up with not quite dead people.”

<What did you do?> asked Varija.

“I infected most of the city with high level tarka,”

<We don’t have the personnel to handle that many people and we don’t have anywhere to put them.>

“What was I supposed to do? Just rescue Mozart and ignore all the others who are dying?” asked Alec.

<You could have waited until we were set up to process them,> 

“Why wait? We are time travelers.”

“Speaking as a professional, he’s going to have far easier time adjusting to the modern era if he has the company of fellow 18 Century Austrians,” said Irmhild.

<We can’t put them on Earth, I won’t be able to slip that many in unnoticed and Mars has it’s own problems,> sent Varija.

“It lucky you have a spaceship then,” remarked Ranjeet.

<It will take years to recruit and train enough personnel to process that many people and to locate and develop colonies large enough to house and feed them,> sent Varija.

“What at else are you going use eternity for?” asked Alec.

<I already have enough projects lined up for several eternities. I need a good project manager and someone has just volunteered.>

“No way! I am retiring.”

<You mean you are going to let those poor people die. Do you have anything better to use eternity for?> asked Varija.

“I will talk to the future version of you about it.”

<I know you will do the right thing.>

“You bitch! Stop trying to manipulate me,’ said Alec angrily.

<Run off then.>

“There is another thing, I think Meg is with {i}Sanity{/i}.”

<She wouldn’t go that far,> asserted Varija.

“The way she has been talking. Can you really say you’re surprised that she has?”

<She doesn’t say anything we haven’t thought at one time or another.>

“I am pretty sure she has gone further than talking. I am pretty sure she is the leader of {i}Sanity{/i},” said Alec.

<Why are you telling this instead of talking to future me?>

“You don’t want to know.”

<Are you talking about 2294 or 2299?> asked Varija.

“Up until 2298 at least.”

<But … > started Varija.

“But everyone left {i}Sanity{/i} in 2294 because there was a consensus that the right people had paid for the Tatienne Arden City atrocities and that {i}Sanity{/i}’s purpose had been achieved. {i}The Cannon{/i} went back to working for the NAIA and {i}The Dragon{/i} went back to working for the Chinese government and everyone pretended that nothing had happened.”

<Only the crazies want to keep {i}Sanity{/i} going.>

“People who believe that the system is fundamentally broken, but isn’t that exactly what we believe,” clarified Alec.

<But {i}Sanity{/i} kills people.>

“Yes.”

<But there is no way I could kill anyone or help people who killed,> sent Varija. <Is there?>

“She’s not you.”

<She used to be.>
