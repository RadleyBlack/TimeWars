Chapter 19 : Welcome to Mars

{b}Location{/b} : near Eagle City, Meridiani Planum, Mars {br}
{b}Era by Mars Calendar {/b} : Sol Solis 15th Kanya MY183 {br}
{b}Era by Earth Calendar {/b} : Thursday 16th March 2299CE {br}

Two figures appeared out of nowhere. In color they were the same orange brown as the rocky plain they were standing on. They were gaunt and androgynous, with thin angular limbs, long narrow torso, and triangular faces that were featureless except for expressive blue eyes and porcupine-like quills instead of hair. 

They were silhouetted against a sky that was blue near the rising too small sun but transitioned to a pinkish red overhead.

One of the figures bent over clutching at their throat.

<Darren, you don’t need to breathe. Just relax and the urge to take a breath will fade. You are a self-contained system.  You have enough stored oxygen, nutrients and power to last a Sol, that’s a Martian day.>

Mark straightened up. <We are really here?>

<Yes! Welcome to Mars.>

Mark took a few tentative steps, then some long bounding lopes.

<We need to head west, Darren.> sent Varija, pointing away from the rising Sun to where the tan colored plain was interrupted by chaotic shapes of blue-grey, blue-green and purple. <And be careful until you get the hang of the gravity. A face plant at full speed is painful and this body doesn’t heal as fast as your old one.> 
 
<It’s very bouncy. It certainly gives you a spring in your step.> Mark leapt straight up, shooting up what felt like several stories. He tumbled, falling unnaturally slowly, just getting his feet underneath himself before he took the massive impact of landing on his legs.

<Darren, what did I just tell you?> 

<My legs are different. It’s not just the lower gravity.>

<Instead of organic muscles supplemented by bio-mechanical fibres, your entire leg is now bio-mechanical, actually everything except your brain is now bio-mechanical. It reduces your oxygen needs by three quarters,> explained Varija.

<I’m some kind brain in a vat?>

<Do you feel like a brain a vat?>

<I feel normal, which is strange, when you think about it. My legs and arms are twitchy through. It’s like they have already finished moving, before I have decided I want to begin to move,> he sent.

<You’ll adjust. In the meantime be careful. You’re not as indestructible as you used to be.>

<When I was falling, I thought I was going to die. The need to breathe came back, only ten times as bad.>

<That was panic. You will adapt to not breathing very quickly. Just try not to kill yourself. This is a hostile environment, even with your enhancements.>

<I don’t even have a mouth.> Darren ran his hand over his face. <How was I breathing before?> he asked.

<You weren’t exactly breathing. You have air intakes underneath your jawline, or what would be your jawline if you still had a jaw. The intakes unlock automatically in oxygen rich environments.> Varija headed out using a slow bouncy lope. After Mark caught up with her after recovering from his foray in the wrong direction, Varija picked up speed.

<This is going to take some getting used to,> he commented as he matched her stride. 

He started running his fingers along the skin underneath his jaw. <They are sealed,> Var sent. Mark was so startled that his twitching legs sent him high in the air. 

<What?> he asked as he landed awkwardly.

<Your air intakes. They are locked for safety reasons. The air pressure is too low. It’s about %1 of earths.>

<I can’t feel them.>

<Of course you can’t, but they will be there when you need them,> she sent. Mark could feel her irritation though the sending. He was about to ask whether she had eyes in the back of her head, when he remembered about the optical sensors on his skin. His old body had them, and when he checked, yes, his new body had them too. So yes, she had eyes in the back of her head.

<Where are we?> Mark asked looking around at the desolation. The tan rocky surface of the plain was gradually being replaced by strange multi-colored outcrops. They almost looked organic.

<We are just outside the capital city of Mars. Eagle City. We need to make our way to the city, meet up with some of my friends and then take them to Newstock,> she sent as they continued towards the dim shapes of their destination.

<How many friends?> he asked.

<About 20 or 30 maybe.> She increased their pace again.

<Good thing we have lots of tents. How come we landed way out here?>

<Eagle City is very crowded.  Extremely over-crowded. It was picked as the capital for political reasons.  The infrastructure and the housing capacity is now strained to the breaking point as more and more government functions are moved here. If we jumped directly in, then we could have killed someone by jumping in on top of them, if we didn’t kill anyone we probably would have been seen appearing from thin air. If by some miracle we weren’t seen then we would have set off alarms because of the pressure changes caused by the jump. So we are stuck out here with a long walk ahead of us,> she explained.

<Is that the city over there?> asked Mark, pointing at strange shapes silhouetted against the skyline.

<That’s sponge> Varija stopped next to one of the strange outcrops. <Like this only bigger.> Varija gave the material a kick. A faint mist rose from the damaged area. It did look a bit like sponge. <It’s a bio-engineered plant analog. It’s very important to the first-wavers. It provides oxygen, nutrients, power and even shelter to them. We have to go through the sponge to get to the city.>

<We better get going then,> he said.

They settled into a rhythm, their feet striking the ground in unison. The sponge outcrops became more and more frequent. They were larger too, with taller growths dotted within them.

<How can I hear our footsteps, when I don’t have ears?> he asked.

<Your quills have sound sensors. They work better with low frequencies, than high frequencies though.>

<My ears are in my hair?>

The gaps between the sponge outcrops were getting smaller. Mark noticed that Varija was avoiding walking on the sponge.

<There are chemical sensors in there as well. Plus they also help regulate the temperature of your skull,> she replied.

Some of the sponge growths were nearly as tall as they were now.

<Chemical sensors! Like a nose? Why can’t I smell anything then?>

<Have you tried?>

Mark concentrated. <I think here is something that smells like wet freshness coming from those.> Mark gestured towards the sponge. 

<Well, there you go.>

<With most of my body replaced by artificial components, that makes me a cyborg doesn’t it?>

<Are you still thinking like that about it?> she turned her face to him as she ran and raised eyebrows at him. The eyebrows seem to be just darker markings on her skin, something like the animated fire tattoos she had when she was Sammy. 

<Well in my day, it was a big deal, there were even serial screeners about it.>

<When dinosaurs ruled the Earth, no doubt. Even before these recent changes, your Tarka components far outnumbered your organic cells. Technically you were already a cyborg. Also, all those bio-mechanical fibres, fabrics and devices were already in your body. It just that now, they are replacing your organics, instead of just assisting them, and of course there are a lot more of them. Compared to that, a few 10s of kilos of biomass, is neither here nor there. Your missing bits are on ice, waiting for you back at the ski lodge, if you are so attached to them.>

<Well, the male of the species is traditionally especially attached to certain parts of that biomass.> Mark said glancing down at his featureless groin.

<Don’t do that. You will trip over and crack your face. I didn’t forget about that part of your equipment. It is all there.>

<Where?>

<It will be available to you when you need it. Now shut up about it or I won’t let you try it out later,> she replied. This time she showed a thin lip where her mouth normally would be and curled it a little.

The sponge growths started to look less like shapeless lumps and more like their namesakes. Stubby little branches and broad leaves became more common. It became impossible not to step on the sponge ground cover as the gaps between patches disappeared and bare Martian soil became less common.

<We are getting close to the territory of the Yellow Square Franchise. They’re a first-wave - umm - collective? organisation? gang? umm tribe? Anyway these first-wave groups call themselves franchises. They don’t really like second-wavers, they call us Earthers, actually they usually call us stinking Earthers, and the second-wavers call them Manties for reasons that will be obvious when you see one. Make sure you don’t call them Manties, make sure to call them franchisees, or Martians,> sent Varija.

<Okay.> Mark had to admit that the images Var sent him of the Manties looked intimidating. They had very broad faces, triangular heads, large eyes, their quills were longer and thicker than Mark’s and Var’s and were clustered in two spots on either side of the head. There was a circular hole near where the mouth would be and there were two triangular ears that were recessed behind the face. They did look a little like a praying mantis. <Are they all Veterans?>

<No. Only half of them are. There have been several generations born since the war. The Veterans control first-wave society though, unlike Earth where the Renewers dominate,> she explained. Var stopped where a yellow tube snaked out of one of the sponge trees. The tallest trees were almost twice their height. Mark could see other tubes attached to other trees. <This is a harvested area. We are now in Yellow Square territory. Try not to damage the sponge. First-wavers claim all sponge as theirs by right. It’s one of the reasons that second-wavers now use bubble farms. It’s a very sore point with the first-wavers. The Earth Corps used to run rough shod over their rights and took what they wanted. It is very difficult to get a first-waver to admit that there is any difference between an Earth Corps drone and a second-waver. We are just all stinking Earthers to them,> she continued.

Var glanced around nervously, scanning the spongy growth. <I better give you your cover identity.>

As he accepted the identity, the chromophores in his skin changed to the Areos Surveyors Corps red and gold colors. His skin was now a deep dark red with a gold silhouette of a bird in flight on his chest.

Var changed as well. Her skin also becoming the same deep red, however her quills and talons were now gold, there was also a gold stripe that ran in a curve down the left side of her body. Her public profile became visible.

<You look curvier and more feminine,> he observed.

<It is all shading. I haven’t actually changed shape. If we run into any Yellow Square franchisees, let me do the talking, Okay.>

<Sure thing. I wouldn’t know what to say anyway.>

The small tubing connected to larger pipes which connected to still larger ones. The bare area soon disappeared and the ground cover blanketed everything. The sponge trees became larger and larger and the gap between the trees became narrower.

<See the blue pipe above us?> asked Lucia.

<Yes.>

<Jump on top of it.>

<You have got to be kidding me,> objected Mark.

<You can do it.>

Lucia jumped almost straight up, alighting with ease on the pipeline. Mark followed suit finding it easier than he though to balance on the curved surface. The pipe seemed to have no difficulty bearing both their weights.

Lucia ran with a smooth graceful lope along the pipeline. Mark followed behind her. The pipe did not go straight, it wove between the trees it was supported by periodic thin pillars. Tubes ran up the pillars to the pipe. As they continued on the tree grew larger still and the ground cover disappeared underneath, leaving only sponge trees and shrubs.

They had gone half a Kay when Lucia halted raising her hand.

<You are trespassing on Yellow Square Holdings. Go back the way you came before we lose patience with you,> sent an unknown person from somewhere ahead.

<We claim rite of passage under the provisions of the Schiaparelli Treaty. Here is our warrant signed by one of the signatories of the treaty, Senator Var Kunasada. We wish only to travel to the city,> requested Lucia.

<We want no Earther trash stinking up our holding. Circle around and use the free corridor.> sent the first-waver. Mark could see him or her now. Their green skin stood out against the mauve tree they were perched on. There was a yellow square on their torso. He could see there were at least three more partially behind the cover of various trees.

<Going by way of the free corridor would leave our oxygen dangerously low. Please let us through. We will skirt the edges of your territory if necessary.>

<Then summon a vehicle to meet you outside our territory,> demanded the Yellow Square.

<We would, but the repeaters, and relays, in your holding seem not to transmit as far as the city. You wouldn’t know anything about those damaged relays would you.>

<We want no more of your thieving kind. Depart or the consequences will be dire for you.>

<At least let us travel to the University. Anyone can go there, can they not? And it will get us out of our holding more quickly than retracing our step,> requested Lucia.

<Go now.> At that there was a large crack and a chuck of tree near Lucia was blown off.

Lucia sent him a data stream and he executed the instructions embedded in it. His legs explosively straightened and launched his body arcing over the trees. He reached the top of his arc and started falling. He could now see that here were at least nine Yellow Squares and some of them were firing weapons at him. The tree near him was suffering damage and some of the Yellow Squares were sending “stop firing” open messages at their friends and others were sending insults at him. There were undoubtedly many messages that he could not hear. Just as he dropped below the trees something hit him hard on the lower right arm, sending him spinning. Something unfolded from his back and the spinning slowed. 

Below him was a yellow line. A pipeline like the one he had just left, but he was now out of position to land on the pipe. A stream of warnings and advisories flashed past on his systems display. He shifted in the air and he felt a push. The push seemed to send him further off course towards the far trees. He curled inwards flipping around so that his feet hit the sponge tree. The sponge cracked and bent, his feet sinking into it. Then he was falling again only this time toward the pipe. His Tarka knew that he was supposed to land on the pipe and had taken corrective action.

His legs hit the pipe like a sledgehammer.  When the pipe stopped vibrating and shaking he straightened up. The pipe was dented where he had landed. He turned his head to see what was behind him.

<Cool! I have wings,> sent Mark

<They can be used for solar collection or for heat dissipation, but they are not supposed to be used for flying. Fold them up and run. They won’t be far behind,> responded Lucia, who took off down the pipe. <Well that certainly could have gone better,> she sent in frustration.

<Where are we going?>

<To East Eagle University, it’s more of a marketplace, a meeting place and a night life area than a school, though it is that too.>

<Will that help get us to the city?> he asked.

<It will give us options.>

As they loped further down the pipeline the sponges grew closer together. At places the sponges met overhead, so that half the time the pipe ran through a tunnel and half the time it would wind though closely spaced sponge like narrow canyons. 

<I don’t think they are still following us .Let me look at your arm,> asked Lucia as she halted in their headlong loping dash.

Mark skidded to a halt next to Lucia. He held his right arm out. There was a plug of hardened pink foam on the inside of his forearm. Lucia dug into the foam with her talons. <Ow!> sent Mark.

<Hold still.> Lucia pulled out a partially flattened bullet. More pink foam oozed out of the hole in his arm and started to harden. <Open and close your hand,> she instructed. <Now tighten them around my fingers,>

<So, what’s the verdict?>

<There is some damage. Your hand will be weaker for a while as some of your muscle fibers have been severed. But over all you have been lucky as you are still able to use it. Also your radius is damaged, one solid blow could shatter it. During combat you should lead with your left and try to avoid blocking with your right arm.>

<Do you think we will see more combat?>

<Yellow Square isn’t the most second-wave friendly franchise but they’re not the most hostile either, if they are firing on Areos Government Officials then relations between the waves are worse than I thought,> Lucia sent. <I was caught up in the negotiations with Earth over humanitarian aid to the outer colonies. Those colonies' very continued existence depends on shipments of Mars’ processed materials and products carried on Earth ships. Shipments that were disrupted by the revolution. It is now obvious that I have lost sight of what was happening under my own nose, in my own city.>

<Do you know what they are upset about?>

<At a guess, it what they are always upset about, sponge and the oxygen, water, nutrients, shelter and power it produces. Thanks to the fusion reactors we have plenty of power, but everything else we are terribly short of. Speaking of shortages, you burned up a lot of your oxygen and water reserves on that little aerial maneuver back there. Stick your head down here,> Lucia pointed down.

Mark ducked his head underneath the pipe where he saw one of the narrow pillars that held up the pipeline. Tubes of all colors of the rainbow ran up the pillar and other tubes ran underneath the pipe, where they met it was a tangle. Lucia did something to his chin and a tube snaked out from under his jaw. She plugged the tube into somewhere in the tangle. 

<I don’t like stealing O{small}2{/small} from the Yellow Squares, but they caused the problem,> she sent.

Mark felt the welcome sensation of breathing fresh air. <That feels good.>

<You need to keep track of your air and power. If you run out of air your Tarka will shut down your brain, slowing down your metabolism to nothing. Your survival AI will be put in charge of your body and that AI isn’t very smart. You don’t want be to be wandering around this place as a Zee.>

<Zee, you mean zombie,> he sent.

<Kiro! Language please.>

<I have heard you use the Z-word before.>

<When I use bad language, I tend to hear little voice that sounds like my father telling me off. That voice has gotten louder recently. Go figure,> she sent. <Getting back to the topic at hand. It is not only the Z-word itself that makes people uncomfortable. People get very uncomfortable around Zees themselves, especially Veteran’s, it freaks them out, gives them flash backs to the Sequestration Wars, even though Survival Zees are very different from Sequestration Zees. That why people reacted out of proportion to the Inkululueko Massacre. Many people find Survival Zees even scarier than Sequestration Zees. So running out of air is very much to be avoided, especially among strangers, but there something that even worse.> Lucia placed her hand on his shoulder and looked intently in his eyes. <Now listen up! If you lose power here, if you drain your SMES cells in this environment, you die, and not just dead, but dead dead. You go non-recoverable very quickly. I will have to grow a clone and restore your memory from backup. Thankfully I just made a backup of you, so you would only lose your memories of Mars. However, do you really want me to have to do that?> she asked.

<I am sensing that the correct answer to that question is no.>

<Then keep track of your damned O{small}2{/small} and power levels.>

<Language!> he sent.

<You should have told me, that you were running low on O{small}2{/small}. I shouldn’t have to check your levels every 2 minutes to find out.>

<Sorry.>

<Don’t apologize. Just check your damned levels. Have I told you how fragile your current body is compared to your old one back on Earth?> she asked.

<Only about 4 or 5 times.>

<Then listen.>

After an awkward silence Mark asked <You were telling me why the Yellow Squares were angry?>

<Are you up for lecture mode?>

<As long as it does not include the words ‘dead dead’, yes!>

<Alright!> she sighed. <If all the sponge was harvested we would have no problem. The first-wavers have been growing and expanding it for almost two centuries. However they won’t allow second-wavers to harvest it and the first-wavers can’t harvest it without a franchise granted by the council of franchises. Even if the council weren't completely paralyzed by politics, there aren’t enough first-wavers that want to branch out on their own and start their own franchises.> Lucia paused.

<We would still have enough oxygen and nutrients, if the bubble farms were fully operational, but they need water and the old water pipeline leaks like a sieve. The Earth Corps did as little maintenance as possible. And, of course the new pipeline from the new ice fields is taking longer to build than expected. You should see the sponge colonies growing around the old pipeline. They have grown enormous from the spilled water. They are all, un-harvested of course.>

Lucia paused again before continuing <We would still be alright if it weren't for the Purists. They won’t give up their more conventional bodies. They consider Areos type bodies or XMEET bodies inhuman. However an Earth style body uses 10 times more resources as a Mars adapted one. It goes as high as 30 or 40 times with some of those old habitats, they leak like a sieve. It wouldn’t be so bad if we could move the Purists to other cities with more resources, however they insist on political representation. Which means Purists in the government and in the support functions.>

<Is that all?> he asked.

<That’s the highlights. Yeah.>

<If the first-wavers have all the resources, why would be they be angry?>

<Because I brokered a deal. Power, Mars Mesh access, manufactured goods, sewage and a little ice for a ton of oxygen and nutrients. The deal had emergency provisions that were supposed to be temporary, just to get us over the current crisis. The crisis has dragged on though, and maybe they are getting impatient. The recent anti-Manty rhetoric on the Mesh couldn’t have helped either,> she sent. <Look the Yellow Square patrol leader could have just been a jerk. It might not mean anything at all. We will have to see what our reception at the University is like. Looks like your reserves are restored.> She unclipped his breathing tube and it disappeared under his chin. 

<Are you really to continue? This pipeline crosses a cable pull that runs from purple diamond territory to the University. We will catch a ride there,> she asked.

<Sure,> he responded. Slowly he got to his feet and they set off.

<This University? How likely are they to shoot at us?> he asked.

<Its neutral territory. They won’t shoot at us.>

<Did you think that the Yellow Squares would shoot at us?>

<Never in a million years,> she sent.

<Then why do you think this is different?>

<It just is.>


They reached a section of the pipe where a cable pylon was visible through the sponge trees. <Ready to jump?> asked Lucia. 

Mark sent the equivalent of a sigh and nodded. The pipe shook as Lucia straighten her legs, sailing over the trees. Mark followed and landed below her on the pylon. Lucia pulled a rod from her thigh. The rod split in two and there was a thin wire running between the two halves.

<Be careful. The nano-fibres are coated with adhesive,> she sent.

Mark followed her instructions and soon had one of the strange devices himself. Lucia leaped and then was being pulled quickly into the distance. Mark leaped. At the top of his arc he tossed the device over the cable and clipped the two halves of the handle together just as he was yanked violently forward. 

He watched the sponge speed quickly beneath him. He bounced each time he passed a pylon.

<Get ready to dismount,> sent Lucia from somewhere ahead of him. He could see the end of the cable pull, where the cable looped back, passing on the other side of the pylon. He sent the release command to the cable handle, then he was falling towards the landing area. He took the impact on his legs and straightened. He was in a large open area full of Manties. Everyone seemed to be looking at him.

<I really hope Var was right about them not shooting us,> he thought.
