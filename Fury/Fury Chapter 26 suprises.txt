{b}Era{/b} : Monday 3rd March 2166CE {br}

The sky was blue. This confused Mark for a moment.

<You died twice. Twice in one day. You need to be more careful. Luckily there wasn’t much information loss from brain damage, so you didn’t lose many memories. As to personality change, are we ever the same person day to day?> The message intruded into the numb blankness he was feeling. His sluggish brain struggled to make sense of it.

<Var?> he asked.

<Who else?>

Like a long lost friend his Varija sense was back. She was standing to his right. <We’re on Earth?> Mark activated his 360 vision. They were in their little ski camp in the Wasting, except it wasn’t so little anymore. There were tents everywhere and at least twenty Areos bio-mechs visible; most were in the official Areos government red and gold colors.

He was lying on a table out in the open, surrounded by five bio-mechs.

<If you are finished stating the obvious, I’d like to introduce you to a few people,> sent Varija.

Mark flipped himself off the table, landed heavily and slightly off balance. Despite the less than perfect landing his body was operating smoothly and easily. It felt good being in a body that worked properly, instead of one he had to nurse along, afraid any extra strain would break his already damaged frame. At the same time Earth gravity made him feel heavy and awkward. He rarely noticed the extra mass of his bio-mech frame in the lighter gravity of Mars, but here on Earth his feet sank deep into the snow and he seemed to fall too fast. He wondered why he was in a Martian bio-mech body. If they were giving him a new body why didn't they put him back in his original organic Earth body?

Varija was sending him something, introducing her Martian friends, but it was too much. He needed some alone time with her or least some peace and quiet. To anyone else Varija’s poker face would have been impenetrable, but Mark could tell she was upset. He flexed his limbs and twirled in a little impromptu dance to get used to his new body. 

He examined the changed camp site. The pristine ski camp on the shoulder of an isolated mountain had been Varija's and his private sanctuary. The Martians presence felt like a violation, an unwelcome invasion of red androgynous humanoids stomping all over the mountain and churning the snow into slurry. From a distance they looked almost Earther style human, except for their skin color and the spiky quills instead of hair. Most had small individual logos on their shoulders. Varija had a golden silhouette of a harpy wielding a whip on hers. However he soon found he could distinguish between them without the logos, from the shape of their faces, the length and arrangement of their quills, and their animated expressions.

When Varija's parents had been here, it hadn't felt like this. Their warmth and genuine affection for him quickly overcame the awkwardness of meeting people who knew him far better than he knew them. They made him feel like an insider and Varija the outsider, three parents against one wayward child. This time there would no trick of time travel to make things easier, he would have to find, or create his place among Varija's friend's the hard way. He should get Varija to teach him how to play slash, as most Martians seemed obsessed with that overly complicated card game.

<Kiro, are you done acting the fool?> asked Varija, reminding him of his current cover identity.

<Just getting used to the new body,> replied Mark. <Why do you always act like this, all formal, prickly, and distant whenever I have scared the crap out of you?> 

<’Kiro’ wouldn't use that expression,> she warned privately. 

<But they already –> started Mark. He was annoyed that he had to conceal his identity from people who were supposed to Varija’s most trusted friends and associates.

<Eventually, our enemies will obtain time travel. Don't make it easy for them to trace you back and find your friends and family,> explained Varija.

<Could you stop doing that?>

<Doing what?>

<Avoiding discussing your feelings by going into lecture mode,> sent Mark stepping closer to Varija.

For a few seconds a crack appeared in her mask. <I was frightened for you. Are you satisfied?>

<No.> Mark put his arms around her and she leaned into him. 

<When you disappeared down that hole, when you didn’t respond, I thought I’d lost you. I thought I’d have to restore you from backup,> sent Varija, squeezing him hard.

<Well I do prefer being there in your arms myself, rather than some cheap knock off.>

<Just don’t scare me like that again,> sent Varija. After a pause she asked <Were you listening, or do I have to introduce you again?>

Still holding her tight in his arms, Mark replayed the introduction in his mind.

The Areos with the golden eagle on her shoulder was Lieutenant Ellen Sarkozi, Varija’s chief bodyguard. Several people he’d met on Mars had mentioned her, usually in connection with her slash playing skills.

<Lieutenant, shouldn’t it be Padwar or something?> he asked as he shook her hand.

<It’s only first-wavers that go in for ridiculous Barsoomian titles,> Ellen replied.

<Try, at least, to pretend to be Martian, Kiro> sent Varija, reminding him of the need to maintain his cover identity.

The Areos with the golden wolf logo was Havel Wolter, Varija’s chief of staff.

<Good to meet you, Mr Wolter,> he sent, shaking his hand.

The Areos with the magnifying glass logo was Jessica Avninder, Varija’s senior legislative assistant.

<Miss Avninder, you would be the source of all those information files on Orange Triangle. Thank you. They were very helpful,> he sent, clasping Jessica’s hand.
< Jessy, please. And you’re very welcome,> she replied. 
The last Areos was the only one not in government red and gold. Instead, his bio-mech frame was blue with a drawing of white Roman style helmet decorating his shoulder. Varija had told him that he was Professor Jordán Upton who would be his second in command for the C-S particle project.

<Professor, I am looking forward to working with you,> he sent, shanking Jordán’s hand. How he was supposed to direct the Professor’s research when he was still catching up on the last 300 years of scientific breakthroughs he did not know.

<Is it really necessary to keep everything secret? Who are these enemies you keep on harping on about?> Mark asked Varija privately.

<I'll piss someone off. I always do. It’s one of my more endearing qualities. My team has been briefed on how important keeping this breakthrough secret is to Mars' security. They’ve been told your identity is sensitive information and they shouldn’t pry.>

<But it’s not for Mars, you are acting on your own with your own agenda,> he sent.
 
<I am still a Senator, or I will be in their home era. Also Mars-related tasks needed to be given higher priority simply to keep them happy. So they {b}are{/b} working to benefit Mars.>

<Why is everyone still in Martian bio-mechs? Why didn’t you put me back in my original body?>

<I thought your poor brain had had enough trauma for one day. Besides, I was hoping we’d transition back to organic bodies together, and I am stuck ferrying people backwards and forwards to Mars.>

<What happened to Naddy and the others?> he asked publicly.

<I sent the codes to free them from lock down as soon as we exited the Sponge Lands.> explained Varija.

<Did you have anything to do with Félix Grünewald waylaying us with fourteen of his friends?> 

<Not directly. I suspect Farkas sent him to capture you, to obtain leverage over me.>

<So you {b}did{/b} blackmail him into helping you?> asked Mark.

<Yes, but he was almost completely useless. He did facilitate the Areos Guard entering the franchise undetected and he was of some help obtaining the sniffer bots which I then outfitted with tick launchers. They worked like a charm by the way. Few people even realized it was the sniffer bots that were shooting at them, but there his usefulness ended. He did not have charge of you and it turned out he did not even know where you were. We turned up at that storeroom he put you in and you weren’t there. Fortunately I started getting those messages from the sensor you hacked into. After getting your location, it was pretty easy to track you using the security cameras. 

Then it turned out that a good chunk of the {i}Concerned Young Franchisees{/i} was in between us and you, and they were heavily armed, and looking for a fight, thanks to receiving code grey and code lilac alerts in close succession. Thankfully our only casualty was a sniffer bot.>

<And me.>

<Yes, unfortunately no one realised that you were booby-trapped,> she sent.

<You said I died.>

<Fortunately we had a mechanic with us. She was able to get your life support back online before too much damage was done and your tarka repaired the damage that occurred.>

<You said I died {b}twice{/b}!>. I > sent Mark.

<Yes. The first time was when I was captured. You came very close to being permanently dead then.>

<Are you going to continue keeping Tony in the dark about what a viper he has in his nest with Jedwar Farkas?>

<No. We kept Farkas in place for information gathering purposes. We have been monitoring his activities very closely. He is a magnet for shady dealings and people with criminal inclinations. Our surveillance producde valuable insight into the Sponge Lands criminal class. However I think he has reached the limit of his usefulness.

Tony didn’t trust Farkas, his own security chief, with guarding you. Instead he gave you to the Princess. He would never have done that if he still had any faith in Farkas. Also the grey goo outbreak is going to be very damaging to him. Deirdre Ayers was one of his underlings. The investigation into the outbreak is going to lead straight back to him. What can you tell us about the outbreak?> asked Varija.

<Ayers shot Miss Tânia Robles with a smart dart. At first the payload of the dart acted identically to standard lockdown or tranq automata, hijacking Tânia’s internal resources, and trying to hack into her nervous system. However none of payloads exploits could compromise her security. It started acting more aggressively, physically attacking her joints, muscles and nervous system. Finally when her immune system automata fought those attacks off, the payload went full grey goo. Consuming Tânia’s physical structure to fuel aggressive replication. I have her system logs detailing the incident. I also have a partial analysis of the payload, from when some of the goo splashed on my leg.> Varija had warned him how dangerous grey goo could be, but nothing had prepared him for people’s reactions when they learnt the self-replicating weapon payload was no longer under anyone’s control – and was aggressively consuming anything resembling bio-mech material. It was as if you told a bunch of Twenty Cents that the nuclear reactor they were standing next to, had gone critical. 

Varija paranoia had saved him. She insisted that they both overclock their immune system response beyond what most people considered safe. She would rather risk death or injury that could result from their immune system mistakenly attacking parts of their own bodies than be compromised by foreign tarka. It had thwarted his captors, preventing them from rendering him harmless. It had saved his life by preventing the grey goo from infecting him. However it also almost killed him by stopping his captors from repairing his injuries. It would have frustrated the hostage rescue mechanic’s efforts to forestall his death, if Varija hadn’t been right there to give the authorization codes.

A big cartoon smile appeared on Varija’s face <I told you Kiro would thread the spear for us.>

< I have run a coding style comparison of the code snippets Kiro retrieved from the goo against the work of registered tarka engineers and known dark engineers. Near the top of the list is a known associate of Farkas named Jonas Davidovich with a match of 73%,> sent Jessica.

<We need to prevent any more goo outbreaks. The defective ammunition must be tracked down and destroyed. I don’t want to restart the clock on the 15th of Kanya until we have everything setup. Can we send someone to Sol Veneris the 13th of Kanya, the same Era as Djordje and Lavonne’s ice delivery mission?>

<I’ll go, but make it 22nd of Virgo.> sent Ellen.

<Are you sure you can stay out of your own way for three weeks?>

<I already did.>

<Don’t bet the bank on a card turn. It’s a bad idea to make it difficult for the universe to prevent a contradiction. You may not like the method it uses to balance the books,> warned Varija.

<Sounds very Zen.>

<I wouldn’t have thought so.> answered Varija who couldn’t see what her religion had to do with the matter at hand. <We won’t be able to use our usual investigators.>

<There are a couple of independent contractors I sometimes use for unusual fieldwork, - Vergil and Reynaud Gorecki,> sent Jessy. <They are both Veterans. Vergil is a first-waver and his husband is a second-waver who regularly passes as first. They both flout the Residency Laws and pass freely between city and sponge lands. One could investigate Ayers and Davidovich, the other could help persuade some of the Jeddaks to vote our way on the Embargo Bill. I have a list of Jeddaks and Jedara that might be susceptible to influence, and some incentives and leverage for each.>

<That is more than a two man job,> protested Ellen.

<They can sub-contract,> sent Varija. <Here is enough untraceable crypto-currency to finance both operations. Do you have an insertion point?>

<The storeroom on level 4.> 

<Are you sure we won’t run into anyone?>

<Not if we arrive at 8:15 on the 22nd of Virgo,> sent Ellen. 

Varija eyed Ellen for moment then nodded. She embraced Ellen and they both disappeared as they T-jumped.  

Warrant Officer Shota Bourke ran up. <There are two unidentified people hooked up to the simulator,> he warned.

A Mars style flatbed transport T-jumped to an empty space at the edge of the tents. Varija and Sergeants Djordje Kristiansen and Lavonne Cassano climbed out of the cab. Varija had retrieved the ice delivery mission.

Varija rejoined the group with the Sergeants in tow. She announced that the ice delivery to the bubble farm had gone well and the workers had promised to keep the ice secret for two days. Even if the first-waver Embargo Bill passed the City would survive. The Warrant Officer repeated his news about unidentified people on the simulator.

<How could I have allowed this to happen? We have run into something our future selves are doing,> sent Varija.

<It could be two natives,> sent Jessy.

<Maybe. Are they wearing any clothes?> Varija asked Shota.

<Some very strange ones. They look extremely old fashioned,> sent Shota.

They were interrupted by three naked people plus skis T-jumping, appearing mid0air further down the slope, landing in the snow. Mark was struck by how odd organic humans looked after a day seeing nothing but bio-mechs.

There was a brief scramble and laughter as a young girl extracted herself from her skis and trotted over to Varija.

<Alec, what are you doing here?> asked Varija.

“That bitch Ellen, wouldn’t let me in to see you. Since it was fairly urgent, I had to find you somewhen else. Where is the bitch anyway? I don’t see her eagle symbol anywhere,” complained Alec.

<Language.>

<Even Dad isn’t as bad as you. And you didn’t answer my question.>

<Ellen is in 2299 at the moment,> answered Varija.

“You do realize that sentence doesn’t even make sense?”

<You understood what I meant,> insisted Varija. The other two humans left their skis where they lay and joined Alec.

“Anyway, there was a big meeting because two of Unka Dar’s friends had been killed and that bitch said I couldn’t come in,” 

Mark almost missed it. Didn’t Varija sometimes call him Unka Dar or Uncle Dar? <Wha-?> 

Varija grabbed his arm firmly. <Nobody here must know you are Darren Steward,> she sent privately.

Mark realized Alec {b}was{/b} talking about him. With rising panic he realized it was two of {b}his{/b} friends that been killed. Was it Naddy or Tânia from Mars? Or Lynn and Cassie from 2246? Or one of his friends from 2017? Anxiety overwhelmed him and he felt as if he could not breathe. ‘You don’t need to breathe, you’re in a bio-mech body.’ Mark told himself. With some effort tried using meditation techniques that Varija had taught him to calm himself.

<Who are you?> asked Mark.

<She is my sister,> sent Varija sharply.

<Channy?>

<No. One of my other sisters.> Since Chandrika Cuevas was Varija’s only sister Mark assumed Varija was being sarcastic.

<How did you get here?> Varija asked Alec.

“Using a C-S particle of course,” she explained. “Unka Dar figured out how to make more of them.” Alec elaborated too quickly for to stop her.

Mark didn’t know what Varija said, but Alec took a quick step back.

“You’re a hypocrite, Tis. You don’t like it when other people create tight time loops, but you’re not above taking shortcuts yourself.”

<It makes me nervous when I don’t know the rules. Do you know all the possible consequences of playing with time?> 

“You jump around time far too freely for that argument to hold water,” accused Alec.
  
<Do you know how to make more C-S particles?> Varija asked him privately.

<Not 'make', exactly, but I have some ideas about how we might obtain more. There is a good chance one of them will work,> Mark replied.

<One of them did work.>

<We need find out more about my friends,> Mark insisted.

<No, we don’t. Any information we receive will only limit our actions. We won’t be able to change anything. And she only knows rumours. She wasn’t allowed in to the emergency meeting that discussed the problem. Any information she has is probably misleading.>

<How could I possibly accept that?>

<If something ever happens to your friends, we will fix it together. I promise,> sent Varija.

“Hi. Alec, could you introduce us to your friends?” asked the male human.

“Varija, Havel and Jessica; this is historian Ranjeet Queen and psychiatrist Irmhild Bloxham. They have been assisting me in a little retrieval project,” said Alec. “Ranjeet and Irmhild, this is Senator Varija Kunasada and her staff members, Havel Wolter and Jessica Avninder. I don’t know the others,” indicating Jordán, Shota and Kiro. 

“Are you Martian bio-mechs?” asked Ranjeet.

“They must be aliens. Martian bio-mechs have triangular faces and two spikey pigtails,” asserted Irmhild.

<You're thinking of XMEETs; a type of bio-mech favored by the descendants of the original Martian colonists. We are wearing the more modern Areos bio-mechs, but we’re just as human as you,> explained Jessica patiently.

“Okay, but why are you still using bio-mechs? You don’t need them on Earth.”

“They have obviously just come from Mars and haven’t had time to change. Now do be quiet, Irmhild.” ordered Alec.

<The two in the simulator, are they with you as well?> asked Shota.

“Yes, they are Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, late of Vienna Austria circa 1791, and Captain Adonis Como from Kapteyn's Star. The Captain is the reason why I was so anxious to get hold of you. I found him using his advantages to indulge in some rather despicable fantasies to the detriment of some poor eighteenth century Austrians.”

<He’s a time traveler from our future?> asked Mark.

“He is a time traveler. The relationship between his era and our own is complicated. From his point of view Kapteyn's Star was colonized two hundred years ago. It was first explored by someone from the twentieth Century called Conway Massey,” explained Alec.

<How is that even possible? The Twenty Cents barely got to Luna.> asked Havel.

“It gets worse. That system was colonized by a mixture of third century Greeks, eleventh century Northern Song Chinese and twenty third century Northern Americans from the Lima Moratorium period,” Alec continued.

<Someone with a time machine is playing God,> commented Varija.

“A {b}government{/b} with a time machine is playing God. They call themselves the Empire of Man, they heavily regulate time travel, and have thousands of colonies in hundreds of star systems.” explained Alec.

<If they are recruiting or kidnapping people in the NAC from the mid-twenty third century, that means they are operating in the same region and Era as our Newstock base. Did this Captain Como say whether his ancestors were willing volunteers?> asked Varija.

“The topic never came up.”

<How did this jerk end up in 18th century Austria?> asked Jessy.

“He was the pilot of an interplanetary craft supplied by the Empire of Man. They limited its allowed destinations, but he hacked into and removed those limitations. Then he jumped to Earth, visiting several time periods, before I ended his crime spree in eighteenth century Vienna.”

<Did you get his spacecraft?> asked Varija.

“No. Apparently it’s parked in some barn in the countryside outside Vienna.”

<We should get that craft as soon as possible.>

“You don’t want to talk to the captain yourself?” asked Alec.

<I’m sure your interrogation was comprehensive.>

“What if this spacecraft is traceable? The owners didn’t track Como down in 1791 but that doesn’t mean they can’t do so in 2166.”

<I still need to look at that spacecraft,> insisted Varija.

“Does that mean I am forgiven?”

<Yes, I will definitely make sure that Ellen does not let you into that meeting.>

“You bitch!” exclaimed Alec.

<This matter answers a question that has been bothering me. If time travel is possible, where are all the time travelers? We need to be very careful with this Empire. They will us as competitors and a threat to be eliminated.

“According to Como, the Empire restricts time travel to its own agents.”

<So I have been right to keep as low a profile as possible.> sent Varija.

“Tis, you keep a low profile? That’ll be the day. I should introduce myself to everyone and explain who I am. After all why should you get to be yourself while I must keep on pretending to be someone else?”

<Don’t you dare! And if you think being a politician means you can be yourself, you are deluded,> warned Varija.

“Everyone already knew who I was when I first met them. Therefore I already have dared.  Tisiphone was only being half truthful when she said I was her sister. I’m far more closely related to her than that. I am Varija ‘Alecto’ Aletea Kunasada and I was born {b}either{/b} on 23 January 2272, or on 14 April 2292, depending on which of us is the original,” announced Alec.
