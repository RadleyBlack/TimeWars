Chapter 17 : Rescue

{b}Location{/b} : Columbia Mountains, Unclaimed Territories, Earth {br}
{b}Era{/b} : Wednesday, 9 March 2163 CE {br}

Mark monitored the squad of warbot’s progress through the snow laden trees using video feeds from multiple drones. They were still moving towards his hide. There was no need to move to one of his other prepared positions. For the first time in a long time he was cold. Despite the security implications he was off loading a lot of his processing to the Comms nodes and drones he had scattered around the mountain side.  He couldn't afford to run hot, otherwise he would show up like a search light to the bots infrared sensors. Besides letting his body temperature rise to its normal levels would cause the antifreeze in his blood to break down into poisonous byproducts.

The thermal blanket covering him was more to hide his thermal signature from the enemy than to keep him warm.  He kept his Himura trained on the point where he estimated the bots would emerge from the trees, monitoring the area using the video feed from the gun site. 

Drone 7 drew his attention to an enemy drone converging on his position. He had thought he had already destroyed the opposing drones, and wondered how many other surprises were in store for him.

Drone 7 had a perfect shot at the enemy's left rotor. He instructed it to fire and winced as the drone SMES cells drained to less than half empty, as its laser discharged. However the enemy drone's left rotor locked, and it spun out of control disappearing below the tree line. He sent Drone 7 back to one of his hidden recharge points, and commanded Drone 11 to cover the gap in surveillance left by the withdrawal of Drone 7. 

A warbot stepped out of the trees to fire a rapid stream of bullets at the retreating Drone 7. Mark commanded the drone to take cover, and without waiting to see the results, specified a location on the bot’s torso and commanded the Himura to fire. A circular dent appeared in the bot’s armor right where he was aiming with a neat hole in the center. Sparks and electrical arcs outlined the warbot telling Mark that at least one of the bot's SMES cells had been short circuited by the micro flechettes and their tailing superconductive mono-filaments that had been the final bot killer payload of the multistage warhead fired by the Himura. Even as the first warbot collapsed as its insides were shredded by nanoaluminum / nanoperiodate explosives and clusters of single crystal flechettes and the uncontrolled discharge of its own power cells, the other warbots opened fire on Mark’s position. Leaves, twigs, wood chips and splinters flew everywhere as the wall of bullets tore through the copse where Mark was hiding. A 15 centimeter splinter was driven though his thermal blanket into his shoulder.

<Christ! Var are you trying to kill me? Those are live rounds,> sent Mark.

<Oh, please! If I was trying to kill you, you would be dead.> exclaimed Varija. <It feels different with live rounds doesn’t it?> 

<This isn’t the virtual world if you misjudge things I will die for real.>

<That’s the point. There isn’t anything like the real thing. And if there is an accident I will bring you back. Your personality might be slightly changed and you might lose a few memories, but you will never notice the difference.>

Mark ordered Drone 9 to launch an anti-bot missile at one of the remaining warbots. The million dollar bot was converted into worthless scrap in a noisy explosion. The surviving bots fired their weapons at the disappearing Drone 9, as it ducked behind a ridge.

Mark scrambled out of his foxhole, and down the slope dragging the Himura out of its firing slit, and slinging it over his good shoulder. He ejected the spent shell casing and loaded a new bot killer shell as he ran to one of his other prepared positions.

<You know it would be cheaper to just to do this in virtuality,> he sent.

<The experience would not be the same,> she sent. <Besides in the unlikely event we ran out of money, I could always confiscate some more.>
It was only when he reached the new foxhole that he reached behind to pull out the wooden sliver embedded in his shoulder. He slid the Himura though the firing slit and dragged a new thermal blanket over himself. The remaining three warbots were now far too close for comfort. He took out another warbot with the Himura which collapsed with the satisfying crackle of discharging SMES power cells.

One of the warbots launched a heat seeking missile. The Himura’s muzzle had heated up enough for the missile to lock on. Mark remote triggered one of the flares he had scattered at strategic points on the mountain. The missile veered towards the lit flare. The missile exploded toppling several trees. He launched an anti-bot missile from Drone 3, and beat a hasty retreat. 

He launched smoke grenades from Drones 2, 6 and 8 obscuring his withdrawal. He took cover behind a small hillock. He ejected the spent shell from his Himura and loaded a new bot killer. He open himself up to the video feeds from the drones and allowed the images to assemble themselves into a 3d model of his surroundings. The integrated information from the drones allow him to {i}see{/i} though the hillside and though the grenade smoke. His head started to ache, as even with all the preprocessing done by the distributed Comms nodes and his tarka, the information overload was a little too much for the organic portion of his visual centers. He cut down the resolution to lower the work load on his poor brain. He ran across the slope until he had a clear shot at the final warbot. Despite the increased fuzziness of the 3d model he could still {i}see{/i} the bot though the smoke as he cleared the tree and the rise he braced and fired. The last bot collapsed in a shower of sparks.

Mark staggered as warmth flooded his body. He let go of the video feeds and the integrated model an rolled in the snow trying to bring his temperature down, then started the process of purging the antifreeze glycoproteins from his system. He couldn’t remove the AFGPs too quickly without rupturing his cells. He lay on his back controlling the nausea and calming his nerves. 

Varija skid to a hockey stop next to him. “Congratulation, it looks like you have mastered the equipment,” she said. She was wearing a body that looked like an older, more mature version of some of the childhood images of her that he had seen.

“Are we ready to rescue your parents?” he asked as he sat. He yearned to touch her, but she radiated heat, and it would take a while for his body to flush the AFGPs out of this system.

“Well, you have a long way to go before you’re any kind of soldier, and I was planning on giving you more training, but all I need is someone to act as look out and maybe provide a diversion if we get any unexpected visitors during the snatch. It looks like you can handle the equipment without blowing off your foot. I was planning on spending a week in Newstock and we were there only a few hours, but you didn’t seem to have much difficulty in adjusting to 23rd Century social norms, in fact I was really impressed by how you wrapped Cloe around your little finger by acting hard to get.”

“That was not deliberate.”

“Never the less, it was impressive,” she stated.

“Are we going now?”

“Not immediately. I have to change back to how I looked when I was 16 and that’s going to take a while because of the wings. You need a disguise but that won’t take much time. I’ll T-Jump us to camp. We can wait in virtuality while I morph.”

“You are too hot!” protested Mark.

“I know,” she said smugly as she grabbed him and jumped.

Mark rolled in the snow again, his skin stinging were she had touched him. “I was talking about the AFGPs in my system.î 

“Yes, I know. I was joking. Let’s get hooked up to the VR equipment.”

++++++

Mark joined Varija near the top of a giant tree. Seated on a high branch they looked out over a green tree top canopy that stretched over the valley. It was one of Var’s favorite places in the virtual world. She was in a depressed and introspective mood.

“We haven’t talked much about our childhoods or about our families have we?” asked Varija.

“Not so much,” said Mark.

“I know people in the 21st Century had siblings. Did you have any?”

“I have a younger sister named Tamara. And before you ask, I am using the present tense because I intend to see her and the rest of my family again.”

ìI promise you will,î said Var. ìHere in the 23rd Century we do not have siblings. It is hard enough to obtain permission from the Fertility Board to have one child. A second child is rarely allowed. However I had two childhood friends, Channy and Luke that were as close to me as I imagine a brother and sister would be. We were all the same age, born within a few weeks of each other. They had been a constant part of my life from my earliest memories, we were inseparable. They were my best friends. I was very close to their parents as well. It was like having 3 mothers and 3 fathers. I got along better with Corny and Ann (Channyís parents) than I did with my own parents and Lukeís mother taught me many things that have been essential to surviving the last 11 years.î

ìThen a few days after my 14th birthday shortly before I was to start university they moved away for reasons that they never fully explained to me. I couldnít even send to them. They cut off all ties. I was left alone and friendless. I was devastated. No-one at University was interested being friends with a snot nosed kid. When a much older girl started paying attention to me, she didnít have a lot of trouble seducing me. I was hurting and vulnerable and Selina was so sophisticated, so cool and she seemed to be committed to making a difference with her involvement with the ëStudents for Open Governmentí. Two years later Selina and my parents were gone as well. In a few short years I had lost everybody who was important to meî she continued.

Mark did not know what to say. Fortunately she did not seem to need him to say anything, so he just hugged her.

ìLend me your eyes,î requested Var.

As he accepted the offered service token, Mark saw his new body though Varijaís eyes. He was standing in the middle of their ski camp and had oriental features but with coal black skin, and was tall and muscular.

ìI look dreadful. What was I thinking?î asked Var.

ìYou were 16 and angry and you wanted everyone to know how angry you were.î

ìYou are making a few assumptions there.î

ìI donít think so. That body is a statement, and not a very subtle statement either,î said Mark. Varís body was now red and black with horns and functional bat-like wings. Wings functional in the sense that they had the full range. ìWhere did you get those?î He pointed to the two body bags lying on the snow. 

ìI cloned them from my parents DNA.î

ìAnd the ethics of the situation do not bother you?î

ìYes, of course they do. However except for the brain stem the connections in their brains are entirely random. They have never known a single moment of consciousness. Their mind contains nothing but noise. Yet they are alive. They are still alive even now, though their metabolism has been slowed to a crawl. I will be exchanging their lives for my parentís lives. I am willing to do this, but it is not without impurity. After all ëAbstaining from taking life, from stealing, and from sexual misconduct. This is called right conduct,íî she quoted.

ìSeems to me you might have problems with the stealing and sexual misconduct as well.î

ìI have never separated property from anyone unless a court of law has ruled they are not entitled to it and my conduct during sex has always been flawless.î Varija eyes flashed with anger.

ìYes, you are correct and I am wrong. Sex with you is always perfect,î Mark stated. While he thought that Varís reasoning about her ëconfiscationsí smelled a little like rationalizations, he really didnít have any right to complain about sex. ìShall we go?î

Varija glanced at the equipment stacked around them. ìThis is going to take a few trips.î

{b}Era{/b} : 12th September 2288CE {br}

From his position perched on the roof of a split level bungalow Mark surveyed the sleepy suburban street containing Varijaís parentís house. The well-lit street was quiet with only two cars and a pedestrian walking his dog travelling the road during the time he and Varija had been staking out the house.

<That is a big house for three people,> sent Mark. He tried again to enter the altered state of consciousness that allowed him to merge the video feeds from the drones into a 3D model, but could not seem to get the knack of it. Maybe it was because of the increased tension in his body. Perhaps it was because he wasnít as familiar with the suburban street as he was with the snow covered mountain.

<Until two years ago nine people lived there. Six of whom had their own home offices,> sent Var. 

Mark stopped trying to monitor all the feeds at once and simply cycled through them. <Drone 8 is picking up a visual on the 16 year old version of you coming out of your third story bedroom window. Sheís now on the roof of the two story section of the house. How is she going to get down?>

<I used to drop on to the roof of the workshop, then off the workshop roof down to the garden.> 

<Yes, looks like thatís what your younger self is doing,> sent Mark. <How long are you going to wait?>

<I only have 23 minutes before a tanker crashes though the sitting room and blows the whole place up. Iím going now.> The video feed of drone 6 showed the older 27 year old version of Varija emerging from the shadows on a nearby rooftop. Picking up two body bags from where she had stacked them previously, she leaped into the air and disappeared.


<Fuck, theyíre not here,> sent Var in a panic.

<Theyíre not in the house?>

<Donít know about that, but theyíre not in the kitchen. Their bodies were found in the kitchen.>

<Where are the clone bodies? The fakes?> asked Mark.

<Here in the kitchen with me.> There was a hint of panic in the sending, out of character for the normally unflappable Varija. 

<The firefighters are going to find the fake bodies in the kitchen. Your parents must be somewhere else in the house,> sent Mark trying to reassure her.

<Yes, of course,> sent Var. <Alright, no need to panic. I will just go and find them.> As the minutes dragged on with nothing for Mark to do but watch a suburb that was quiet as a grave he forced himself to practice the meditation techniques that Varija had taught him. Unable to concentrate on the meditation exercises he switched to breathing techniques instead.

<I found my father!> Var exclaimed. <He was in the workshop. He couldnít hear me calling because the workshop is sound proofed. I still cannot find my mother.>

<You have only twelve minutes left, why donít you phone her?>

<You mean send her? I canít. She has strict rules about sending inside the house. She says that home time is family time and we should be focused on each other when we are home and not engaged in outside business. She has set up her tarka to block incoming calls while at home unless she is in her home office. I tried sending her and I am getting blocked.>

<The phone system, sorry, the communication system should be able to still triangulate her position. She hasnít turned it off, sheís only blocked it,> sent Mark.

<But that is locked down, only authorized - >

<Surely the system renowned Mage Fury can hack into it.>

<Right. Of course.> she sent. <Alright, I have hacked into the communication system. I have the coordinates,> she continued. <Fuck. I am back in the kitchen again. The communication system says she is right where I am standing,>

<Right. You have the right X, Y coordinates, what about elevation? Do you have a basement?>

<No! No basement.>

<Whatís on the second floor above the kitchen?> he asked. He noticed movement at the end of the street. He flew Drone 4 closer to the figure walking along the sidewalk.

<Ann and Cornyís room, but Iíve already checked there.>

<Check it again.> Mark zoomed in using Drone 4's optics. The figure resolved itself into Varija's neighbor, who was walking his dog. <Mr. Dunai is back early from his walk. If he keeps this up he will be to close the blast zone when that tanker crashes into your house. He could be killed or injured.> 

<I can't think about that right now. Just deal with it.>

Mark remembered the transcript of Dunai's interview during the inquiry to the 'accident'. He had apparently been knocked over by the blast. Trauma induced amnesia meant he had trouble remembering the events leading up to the explosion. Mark sent a command to Drone 7, the one he had mounted a Paredes Tranq. Riffle onto. Dunai collapsed. Mark wondered if he would have to shoot the dog too, however the dog stayed with its master making it unnecessary. Mark had realized that Dunai had never suffered from amnesia. The reason why Dunai would not remember the tanker or the explosion was that he was unconscious, knocked out by a Tranquilizer dart.

<No she is not here. She hasnít moved the comms is still reporting the same location,> Varija sent.

<What is above Ann and Cornyís room?> Mark asked.

<The roof-space we use it for storage.>

<Check there,> he sent. Anticipating the next logical step Mark sent drones 9 and 5 to sweep the roof. He found a beautiful woman lying on the roof wearing nothing but a floppy red hat.

<She is not in the roof-space,> she said.

<She is on roof.>

<What is she doing up there?> 

<She is looking at the stars. Oh Christ! She is next to your bedroom window. She is waiting for you to return so she catch you in the act of sneaking back in,> sent Mark. He watched as one of the roof tiles jumped upwards. <What are you doing?>

<Getting on to the roof by the most direct route. Iím running out of time. If I take the long way around though my bedroom I will run out of time.>

<Just T-Jump.>

<That would create anomalous damage that the fire investigators might notice,> she sent as something hit the tile again from underneath and it went flying leaving a hole in the roof.

<You are never going to get though that gap with your wings.>

<I can fold them tight. I will get though no problems.> Varís mother sat up and was looking around. She had obviously heard or felt something as Varija had broken through the roof. The hole was on the other side of the peak of the roof, so Mary Jane did not see the hole or her daughter wiggling though it immediately.

Varija was half way through the hole in the roof when Mark spotted the tanker barreling around the corner. <Itís here! The tankerís here. T-Jump now!> Mark urged. The tanker screamed pass Marks position and slammed into Varijaís house exploding as it ploughed into the dining room. Mary Jane had crossed over the peak of the roof and Mark caught a glimpse of her reaching towards her daughter though Drone 9ís optics before the drone span out of control, tossed by the shock wave. He switched to Drone 5 by all he could see was an expanding fireball.

Numb with shock Mark stared and the burning house. He was still staring when a dark figure tackled him and he was blinded by a bright light and landed on snow. He blinked trying to adjust to the light.

ìYou bitch, you could have been killed,î said Mark, staring up at Varijaís battered and bleeding face.

<Oh please! That was never going to happen,> sent Varija. <I had a whole half second to spare.> She helped him to his feet.

ìFrom the looks of you, you were a half a second too late,î replied Mark scanning his surroundings, Var had jumped them back to the middle of their ski camp. ìHow is your mother?î

<Mum and Dad are in the big tent. You need to change back into your Darren persona before they see you. And keep quiet they can hear you.> The cuts and bruises on Varijaís body were already starting to heal.

<What about the drones and the other equipment?>

<I ordered them to extraction point Beta. I will pick them up later. Now change your appearance quickly,> sent Varija. Mark initiated a quick change. His body exploded with pain. He gasped, then the pain was gone as Varija blocked his pain receptors. <You really need to learn how to do that yourself,> she sent.

<How can you do this all the time?>

<I do this trick where the pain seems to belong to someone else,> she sent. <Why donít we have a break and visit Newstock. Now that theyíre safe and we know that we have not triggered any probabilistic anomalies by rescuing them we can relax. We could spend a week in Newstock and only a second would have passed for my parents.>

<Why are you avoiding your parents? What are you afraid of?> he asked. The wind picked up and a sprinkle of snow began to fall. 

<While we been together, it has been relaxed and natural. You havenít had preconceived ideas about who I am, or where our relationship is going. You have been able to see me clearly. This is going to change. We are entering a world where people think they know us and think they know what our future is going to be.> She stepped closer and held him tight.

<Do you really think so little of me? To think that I would be influenced that way.>

<You would be surprised. However there is one thing that scares more than anything. Do remember what we discussed when we were playing bots and Indians? When we talked about the possibility of you dying?> she asked.

<Yes, you were pretty callous.>

<That wasnít callousness, that was fear and frustration. I wasnít worried about you getting killed in a situation that I was tightly monitoring and controlling, I was more worried about you being killed in future situations where I did not have control. You donít take your training seriously, Mark. And itís going to get you killed. You have no idea how much danger you are in by simply standing next to me. I am a bullet magnet and itís my worst nightmare that you will be killed and I will have to bring you back out of the pieces that are left. No-one is ever quite the same afterwards. If you get killed too many times, you get personality corruption. I have seen that first hand and you donít want that.>

<Why are you making such a big deal about this. We are safe. Your enemies are 150 years in the future and have no way of getting to us,> he said.

<Every time I have thought I was safe someone has tried to kill me. Even if I have outrun my old enemies, I will just make new ones. I am a disruptive influence and I interfere with other peopleís plans. I just canít help myself and I wouldnít avoid rocking the boat even if I could.>

<Thatís sounds pretty cracked. Are you sure your paranoia isnít getting the better of you?>

<Every time I have asked myself that question it has turned out that I have not been paranoid enough,> she said.

<I am not sure what any of this has to do with us talking to your parents, other than the fact that you seem to be inventing reasons not to talk to them.>

<Just promise me that whatever you learn you wonìt do something stupid because you think you canít be killed.>

<Alright, now you have got my interest. It is hard to believe any meeting could live up to the hype after a build up like that,> he said.
 
<You wonít be bored I can guarantee that, because now comes the hard part, which is dealing with my parents.>

<Are your parents that bad?> he asked.

<No. But I have just kidnapped them. Now I have to convince them to pretend to be dead and to not ever tell anyone that they are alive, not even their closest friends and family. Also they still think I am 16 and they probably wonít approve of our relationship when they find out about it.>

<Is that because I am not a Buddhist?>

<No. Itís because my family life is about to become complicated and awkward. I may have left out a few things,> she sent.

<Do you feel like sharing those complications now?>

<Itís easier just to show you.>

<Easier for who?> he asked in frustration.

<We better go in before they come out,> sent Varija as she ducked into the tent.

Mark followed. As he entered the tent he was tackled by a naked disheveled redhead.

ìDarren! Iím so glad youíre here,ì exclaimed Mary Jane, hugging him tightly. ìHas this wretched girl abducted you too?ì Mary Jane was somewhat worse for wear with cuts and bruises on left arm and lower leg. Mary Jane was healing although not as quickly as Varija. It looked as if Varija had protected her mother from the worst of the damage with her own body.

<Would it have been asking too much to give me a heads up about this?> asked Mark.

<Hug mum otherwise she will think something is wrong,> replied Varija. <I needed your reactions to be natural.>

ìIt is good to see you,î said a handsome young Asian who Mark recognized from images as being Varís father Roger.

ìYes, there are many things Uncle Dar and I need to talk to you about. You may want to sit down,ì said Varija.
