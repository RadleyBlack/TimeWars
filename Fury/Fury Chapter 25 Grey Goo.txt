<I can fix it. She will need water, as much as everyone can spare,> sent Mark stepping forward quickly. 

<Oh fuck no!> wailed Tânia.  <This just keeps getting better.>

<I’m going to need medical admin rights to your frame,> requested Mark.

<No, No, No! Fuck that for a joke,> refused Tânia.

<You have a grey goo infection. That’s an aggressively self-replicating automata ecology that lacks proper limitations and safeguards.>

<I know what grey goo is,> retorted Tânia. 

<You don’t have much time. You need to trust me,> insisted Mark. He placed his hands over her entry wound and sprayed a fine mist from his finger tip bee-sting launchers.  There was a flash and a pop as the mist hit the damaged skin. He continue to coat the skin around the wound circling outwards.

<That’s probably the last words that a prison guard wants to hear from her prisoner,> complained Tânia. <What are you spraying on me?>

<Anti-goo. Someone give her water. I’ll probably need some more feedstock. I am going to need to manufacture a lot of this stuff. Your medical admin rights! Quickly!> urged Mark.

<What are you planning?> asked Nadja

<Ramp up her immune system to max, then cut it out of her,> sent Mark. 

<You will cook her brain,>

<Not if I am quick,> sent Mark. <Tânia, when I do this it is going to get very hot in there. Do what you can to keep your temperature down. Vent if you have to. Now is not the time to conserve water.  Where is that water?>

<I think he’s right Tânny and by my estimate you only have about 5 minutes,> sent Nadja. Finally Tânia’s teammates threw her some water. She caught three containers one after another, and screwed them into her inlet ports.

Tânia slapped something on his chest. Mark didn’t need to look to know that it was another tase grenade. With it came an encrypted token for Tânia’s medical administration rights. <I didn’t expect thanks, but …> to Mark’s intense annoyance he didn’t have time to express just what he thought of her. Not if he wanted to save her life. <Everybody keep back.>

His nano-blade flicked out with a twitch of his muscles. He drew a line on her skin with a corrosive which was designed to weaken it. He linked with Tânia using the token she had given him and transmitted a pre-programmed package of instructions that had been written by Varija when she had been a part of the Anti-Sequestration League. The nano-blade swept out a second time tracing the same path as before only this time the blade plunged through her skin and sliced across her stomach. The nano-blade bent and the tip of the blade snapped off, it had not been designed to withstand that kind of punishment, but it had lasted long enough. Pink sealant foam gushed out of the wound carrying with it the grey goo. The goo burst into flames attacked by the anti-goo mist that Mark was spraying on one side and the tarka embedded in the foam on the other.

The toxic mess landed on the sponge and started eating into the floor. Hot glowing gases escaped the bubbling mess in tiny flaming jets before being rapidly dispersed in the thin atmosphere. Black smoke spread rapidly from the goo and foam mixture filling the corridor.

Mark dragged the staggering Tânia away from the still dangerous goo. Her skin was bright in the infra-red and hot to touch. She was venting steam. Inside her, two opposing armies of nano-bots were locked in a battle for survival, however now that the main body of the goo had been ejected from her body, her tarka now had the upper hand over the enemy stragglers. The conflict and mutual destruction was generating an enormous amount of heat and thanks to Mark increasing the aggressiveness of Tânia’s immune system the good guys were doing almost as much damage as the bad guys.

<How are you doing for water?> asked Mark.

<So hot!> slurred Tânia, who staggered and ended up leaning on Mark.

<Does anyone have any more water?> asked Mark. Silva tossed him a canister. Mark caught it and screwed it into one of Tânia’s free inlet ports.

Mark continued to spray anti-goo at the bubbling mixture on the floor.

There was a flash and pop as a particle of goo hit his leg. Mark cursed and sprayed Tânia. A couple of pops and flashes told Mark that she had been splashed on the legs as well. <Everyone get back,> Mark warned. He tried spraying the entire area. There were flashes where the mist hit goo. He finally managed to convince Monika of all people to give him some of her spare feedstock.
<This is bad. It’s a lot more aggressive than I thought. It’s completely slipped any limitations that were placed on it by whatever incompetent engineer cooked this automata up. You need to call a code lilac. Make sure that they know that Deirdre Ayers is responsible for this outbreak. That smart dart gun is evidence. No-one should use it. That ammo will need to be treated very carefully.

<Code lilac. That’s something from the Sequestration Wars,> sent Nadja.

<Every decade or so some idiot manages to recreate goo by accident. Even rarer is when someone is psychotic enough to create it on purpose. Ayers needs to be questioned. We need to find out where she got the payload for her darts and if there is any more of this stuff out here.>

<How did you know what to do?> 

<I spend a good deal of time with someone who is obsessed with preventing a second lot of Sequestration Wars. Naturally she taught me how to deal with many of the main weapons of the last Sequestration Wars, since she is convinced that they are about to make a big comeback.>

Mark dipped his broken nano-blade into the now black sludge and stirred. There a burst of activity, then it quietened down. <I think that that's it. This whole area will need to be decontaminated just to be sure.> He gave everyone a final once over with the anti-goo just to be sure. 

 
Glancing over to where Tânia sat with her head between her knees, Mark asked, <Are you okay?> 

<I'm alive, whether I'm okay is another question.>

<Can you walk? I'm not willing to stick around to talk to the Jedwar's goons,> sent Tidir.

<Her temperature is coming down.> sent Nadja as she helped Tânia up. Tidir paced as Nadja bound Tânia’s wounds in tape

They continued on towards Boomerang territory, leaving Félix and his friends to the tender mercies of the code lilac response team.

<I don’t understand why Félix risked so much to try to get you back. Grey goo that’s …> sent Tânia.

<It’s horrifying. But I think the Grey goo was a mistake. The smart dart’s payload had an escalating response, every time it failed to take you down, it tried something more extreme. Eventually it escalated past its own safety mechanisms. There is a reason why only experts are allowed to mess with self-replicating automata. There is a reason the safety protocols are so rigid. The person who created that payload was less of an expert than they thought.>

<They are going to kill Ayers. Aren’t they?> asked Silvia.

<Releasing grey goo is a capital offence, yes. They won’t execute her before they get every speck of information out of her though,> sent Mark.

<Why would she talk if they are going to kill her anyway?>

<They will lie. Give her false hope.>

<That’s horrible,> objected Silva.

<More horrible than grey goo? Any grey goo incident is a potential extinction level event. The goo we just destroyed attacked bio-mechs only. If it has started using sponge as food?> Mark shuddered at the thought.

<What a depressing conversation!> Irina sent from where she was draped over Monika’s shoulder. Everyone stopped. Nadja examined her and pronounced her out of immediate danger. Irina insisted on standing on her own feet and everyone felt the need to hug her, pat her or kiss her. Mark stood awkwardly feeling like an outsider, while the others milled around reassuring themselves that Irina was okay.

Tidir bullied the others into moving again. Mark looked around, he had a sense that Tânia would normally be the one to get them back on task. He saw the green ‘Rang leaning against the wall. Nadja had done a good job taping her burnt chest and her slashed stomach.

<Are you okay?> asked Mark.

<What! Is this some sort of Chinese obligation? You save my life two or three times and you feel the need to look after me forever after?> asked Tânia.

<Do you feel like talking about it?> Mark helped steady her and she didn’t object.

<What is there to talk about? I was almost eaten by nano-bots and I had to be saved by the person I was supposed to be guarding.>

<If you hadn't opened fire when you did, Félix would have fired that crystal shot and his friends would have gotten off many more shots than they did. They would still have been locked down, but we would have been cut to pieces.>

<You make a strange spy, Mr Doyle,> sent Tânia.

<I was never a spy.>

<You are definitely not a surveyor.>

<I have been many things. At the moment, when I am not a hostage, I am a surveyor,> insisted Mark.
<Right.>
After a long pause Mark asked. <Do you have history with {i}Red Mars{/i}? You seemed to know them.>

<I was a member of {i}Red Mars{/i} back when they were fighting the Earth Corps, and before they decided that they were the guardians of Martian purity.>

There wasn’t anything in the info packs Varija had sent him that mentioned the activity of {i}Red Mars{/i} after the revolution. It seemed something that Manty Relations team, Jessy and Martin should watch. <You sound bitter.>

<Wouldn't you be?> asked Tânia.

They proceeded the rest of the way in silence.

They rounded the corner to find four auto-cannons in sentry mode and 11 heavily armed Boomerangs all pointing their weapons in Mark's escorts’ direction. 

Nadja picked a red and white ‘Rang and walked up to him <Rohan, what's with the artillery?> she asked.

<Someone called in a code grey and a code lilac. You wouldn't have anything to do with that would you?> asked Rohan.

<I didn't think the {i} Concerned Young Franchisees {/i} had this much fire power.>

<The printers have been running hot since {i} the troubles {/i}. After decontamination, Irina and Tânia will be escorted to the mechanics and the rest of you are headed into quarantine I am afraid.>

<I’m going with Irina,> announced Monika.

<I’m going with Tânia,> declared Tidir.

<Fine, they can each have one hand holder but no more,> conceded Rohan.

<Don’t need immediate mechanical attention. I can wait until I can see my own mechanic,> insisted Tânia.

<You don’t get a say. Your core life support unit will be removed and placed in a temporary body. Your current body will be slagged down into it component atoms. The temp is a Sumatra model, I know you like Tenerife models, but the Sumatra was the closest we could get in such short notice.>

<This is unacceptable. Where do you get off being so high handed? I want to see Pram.>

<This comes straight from the Jeddak. Pramod has approved this, as has the {i} Concerned Young Franchisees Executive Committee {/i} and the {i} Student Housing Association Advisory Council{/i},> sent Rohan.

<Bullshit! There is no way you could have gotten a quorum for either of the committees on such short notice and the Jeddak is under communication interdiction at the Council of Franchises.>

<Quorum or not, no-one is taking any chances with this. You are lucky they didn’t decide to slag this whole instance, organics and all, and then restore you from a clean backup. As to the Jeddak, apparently he was outside the interdict, dealing with some sort of emergency message from the Princess when this went down. Don’t make this difficult Tânia.>

Tânia looked at the weapons pointed at her. <So I’m an instance now, am I?> she asked.

<Tânia please?>

Tânia raised her hands. <Don’t worry. I’ll come quietly.>

<{i}Earth fell and Mars starved!{/i} Tânia don’t be like that. Once we get some printer time we will put you in a nice Tenerife branch XMEET with all the extra options. The Jeddak is paying.>

They were escorted to the decontamination tent with Tânia still complaining. <Oh! If the Jeddak is paying that makes it alright.> They were sprayed with anti-goo. Mark was pleased to note there was no telltale flash and pop that indicated that the nano-bots that saturated the anti-goo had found and annihilated their grey goo nano-bot prey. He had already decontaminated the party. Their weapons were confiscated, that is those weapons that were not built into their bodies were confiscated. The smart dart gun and its ammunition were separated out and packed in special containers, which were treated gingerly, as if they contained ticking time bombs. Mark was just glad that they were treating it seriously. 

Mark, Naddy, Silvia and Tomás were led one way and Tânia, Tidir, Rina and Monika escorted in a different direction. Mark realized he probably would never see them again.

They ended up in what looked like a break room. There was an area that dispensed consumables. There was also a ball court and aseating area.

Silvia and Tomás occupied themselves playing handball while Naddy and Mark watched from the seats.

<So how long do you think we will be here?> asked Mark.

<I don’t know. This is my first code lilac. We could have kept quiet about the goo you know,> replied Nadja.

<That would have been a bad idea. We don’t know who else has the same payload. Have there been any unexplained murders or  disappearances lately?>

<It would be hard to say. We had been flooded with refugees. Many people here don’t exist officially. It makes it hard to keep track of people. We move in groups while we are out of our territory now, though. An entire group disappearing would be noticed. I haven’t heard about any deaths since {i}the troubles{/i} quietened down though. Beatings, yes. Deaths, no.>

<How did it get this bad?> Mark asked.

<When the Earth Corps were stealing our air and water, we all knew who the enemy was. We all worked together. Now they’re gone, there is nothing to hold us together, the conservatives and the progressives want very different things. To many conservatives, we Boomerangs are the heart of the problem, even though not all Boomerangs are progressives, and not all Grandpas are conservatives. Things aren’t all bad though. When the {i}the troubles{/i} began, we seized this area. It used to be student housing. Cheap and undesirable because it was so difficult to get here from anywhere important. Now that just means it’s easily defensible. You’re safe here. That’s why we get so many refugees.>

<And the Jeddak is okay with you having your own little kingdom within his empire.>

<Jeddak knows how it was during {i}the troubles{/i}. We had to protect ourselves. Jeddak Barends is a progressive even though he’s a Grandpa. Sometimes he has trouble with his Grandpas and we are a useful counter-balance. Since the old Grandpa CFO disgraced herself and the Princess became CFO we have had more influence,> explained Nadja.

<You know we never finished that dance.> sent Nadja as she stood up.

<I had the impression that you thought it was a waste of time.>

<No, I didn’t think that. It was nice. How did it go again?>

Mark stood and embraced her. He picked a different song with a similar beat to the last one, he shared it with Naddy and they danced. She seemed to be in less of a hurry than last time. On the second song she started kissing him. The third song she was grinding herself against him. The fourth song had barely begun when she was pressing his groin to release his genitals. She wrapped her legs around his hips. He noted that Silvia and Tomás had stopped playing handball.

He unsealed her groin with his tentacles and spread her pussy lips. He teased her with his shorter third tentacle. <Please fill me up with your Lovecraftian horrors from the deep,> she begged as she rocked her hips.

He slipped one tentacle inside her and then two. He was just getting into it when she stopped. Letting go of him she dropped to the floor.

<Someone’s attacking the border guards. Damn those Grandpas, why can’t they leave us alone.> Silvia and Tomás walked towards them.

<I don’t think it’s the Veterans.> sent Mark. 

Two sniffer bots burst into the room. Nadja slapped her chest. <Kiro, you bastard!> she sent.

Mark triggered the nano-aluminum / nano-periodate explosives that he had built up underneath the two tase grenades attached to his bio-mech body. Throwing the grenades away from him. 

He wanted to explain to Naddy that he wasn't the one who shot her, but it was too late. The grenades triggered launching hundreds of single crystal needles outwards. The crystals trailed super-conducting monofilaments that lead back to the SMES cell at the core of the grenade.

Some of the needles were knocked aside by the expanding gases from the explosion, the trailing threats snapped. Others were stopped by the armor he had been building up. Most of the needle weren't even travelling in the right direction to hit him and more hit Naddy than hit him, giving her a bad shock. However some needles got through to him, especially those that hit his arms and legs. Current from the two SMES cells surged though his body.  Most of it was channeled away from sensitive areas protected by strategically placed circuit breakers and diverted through prepared cables. However the voltage was so great that the current arced across normally insulated systems. Already damaged components burnt out or even melted. For Mark there was pain, light and then darkness.
