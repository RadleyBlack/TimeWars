Mark drifted into semi-awareness amid an ocean of strawberries, mint and chocolate. He felt very comfortable nestled against something warm and soft. 


He reached down to scratch, then snapped awake. A frantic grab with his other hand found what he was searching for much to his relief. Then he remembered.


<Good morning sleepily head,> came a voice in his head.


<Is this morning? It looks like it is still night,> he asked.


<You have had two whole hours of sleep. You will need far less once you have fully adapted to the tarka,> Ichigo sent.


Ichigo turned around and melted into his arm like she was made for them. She kissed him with a fire and passion that was enough to curl his toes. He felt something tighten around him and he realized that he was still connected to the dildo and the dildo was still inside Ichigo’s cunt. As she rhythmically squeezed it felt just as if she was squeezing his real cock or how his cock would have felt if it was ultra-sensitive and prehensile as an elephant’s trunk. The previous night he had climaxed more than he would have thought humanly possible, many of them the strange intense double orgasms he got when his nervous system was wired up to Ichigo’s 2nd favorite sex toy.  They had run out of the dildo’s capsules and his poor balls had given until there was nothing more to give. Despite the night's marathon activities, his morning wood had gotten up before him and was standing to attention rock hard. He should be exhausted. His cock, the real one at least should be red and raw, but he felt wonderful.


<After last night’s exercise, aren't you sore?> he asked.


<One of the benefits of trans-humanity is increased stamina,> she sent. She rolled him over on his back and pressed his cock against the entrance to her ass and started pressing down.


<Trans-human? Are you saying that we aren't human anymore?> he sent. He gasped as the tip of his cock broke through her sphincter.


<We are what it is to be human but without the brakes. Ever heard of Douglas Engelbart?  He was from your era wasn't he?> She pushed down taking more of his cock into her bowels.


<The guy who invented the mouse? Yeh, give or take 50 years.> He was having difficulty concentrating as the sensations from his cock buried deep in Ichigo’s ass combined with the feelings transmitted from the sensors of the dildo inside her cunt threaten to overwhelm him. 


<His idea was to augment humans, to give them tools to overcome their limitations. Three hundred years later, we can do better than his “easier to use” computers. Repeat these numbers 812831038648792832039215712538419823.> She grunted as she punctuated every couple of word thoughts with a push downwards on to his cock.


<812831038648792832039215712538419823. Was there a point to that?> he asked. It was good that remembering the numbers took no effort considering the distractions.


<Humans can only hold seven plus or minus two items in their short term memory. I could have recited numbers for an hour and you still could have repeated them. You have been augmented and some of your limitations have been removed. The real benefits will come when you figure out ways of doing things that are only possible now that those limits have been removed. That takes time. No more distractions, no more questions. And use that arm or I will take it back.> she increased the pace and the vigor of her thrusting.


<Actually I really have to pee,> he sent.


<Hold it in.>


<It is uncomfortable.>


<There,> she sent. The pressure on his bladder now seemed distant as if it belonged to someone else. <You have got to learn how to do that yourself.> 

Mark flexed the dildo in Ichigo's cunt and was rewarded by a moan from her. He used his borrowed hand to stoke her clit. He felt her sphincter tighten and flutter around his cock and her cunt clamped down on the dildo. In the flood of sensations he was no longer able to tell the difference between his real cock and the artificial one and no longer cared.

Ichigo started keening and rocking her hips. Mark could feel the thin membrane between her back passage and her cunt as her thrusting motions squeezed the dividing wall between the two cocks. She started trembling and shaking. Her cunt and bowels tightened rhythmically around his cock and the dildo.

His climax crested and washed over him. His buttocks tightened and both cocks pulsed as they emptied all he had into her cunt and bowels. His whole body tightened and shuddered as another climax swept through his body. His body tried to squeeze more out of already empty balls. Wave after wave of orgasm swept through his body,trying and failing to fill Ichigo’s body with additional seed. He could not seem to stop himself. His body tingled and lights flashed at the edge of his vision until finally he was able to stop.

<What was that?> he asked. A powerful feeling of well-being and inner peace flooded his senses.



<The activities last night and this morning were a little more stimulation than you are used to,> she replied.


<You are going to end up killing me.>


<Your body is more robust than it used to be.>


<I am more worried about my mind,> he sent.


<Your mind is more robust as well.>


<I feel like I am high on something.>


<Yes, natural hormones. Good news is that the tarka won’t flush them like artificial drugs. I really miss Coffee and Scotch,> she sent.


<I am already missing hot showers and hot baths.>


<I can teach you how to use the tarka to keep warm.>


<It’s not the same,> he complained. <Are you always this active? This relentless?>


<Well the excitement of a new lover always gives things a boost. Plus it has been a while. I have been a little frustrated. I have always been fairly active. Maybe not so much as last night, but I would never get anything done if I went full throttle every night.>


<Oh god! You are going to wear me out.>


<Ha, Ha! You will adjust. Besides we will be much too busy with your training to overindulge in social activities,> she sent. <You are going to rupture something if you don't pee.> 


<I completely forgot,> he sent as he disentangled himself from Ichigo and clambered out of bed. As Mark made his way to the toilets he could still feel the arm that Ichigo had lent him. He reached up and tweaked her nipple. He felt something pinch his own nipple. He looked down and watched his bad arm move of its own volition. 


<I am still hard. I am having trouble peeing,> he sent.


<You have total control of your body. Just relax there,> she advised.


He relieved himself and made his way back to the bed. Ichigo welcomed him back with a passionate kiss.


<You are amazing. I can't believe you don't already have a boyfriend.> 


<Um.>


<You already have a boyfriend?> he asked.


<Um.>


<You already have a girlfriend?>


<Um,> she sent.


<You already have two boyfriends?>


<It’s complicated. Being on the run for the last 11 years has been hard on my love life. Then there is my winning personality. I have been accused of being dominating, overbearing, arrogant and my all-time favorite ‘unable to be spontaneous’. As if it is my fault that I am good at planning. Then there is my attitude that every day could be my last.  At first I was angry with the world, then I wanted to change the world, then I wanted to party like it was the end of the world, and then I wanted to party while I saved the world. It takes a special person to put up with me. Despite this, a surprising number of people wanted to be with a crazy girl who acted like a hyperactive Lemming sucking on ultra or for an interesting seven month period, a mad feral boy on swoosh. The relationships that did not end in tears and a screaming match ended when I had to sneak away in the middle of the night after the authorities got too close.


Now thanks to the time jumper many of the people I left behind are going to be re-entering my life and some because I left them in danger. Some because I need allies. Some have moved on but others are going to want to resume our relationship. They all mean a lot to me and I was with each of them for a reason. You are going to meet many of these people and it would mean a lot to me if you tried to get along with them. There is going to be drama. I could use your ability to stay calm in difficult situations. Would you be willing help me keep everyone from killing each other?> she explained.


<I have so much Oxytocin in my bloodstream that I love the world so now is probability not a bad time to ask me for a favor. What mad scheme are you trying to rope me into now?> he asked.


<It is not only going to be my ex-lovers causing problems. What I have in mind is going to take more than the two of us. I will be building a team and the people I have in mind are strong individuals with pre-existing ideas and strong will. Getting them lined up in the same direction is going to be a challenge.


I am thinking a little social engineering may be in order, if you could follow my lead pretending to support or argue with me,  to be my boyfriend or enemy depending on the situation?>


<That sounds very Machiavellian.> 


<If left to their own devices many of the people I want to recruit are probably going to want to do something stupid like use the time jumper to kidnap world leaders. I think I can come up with a plan that is less confrontational and more likely to succeed. With most of the recruits I have enough credibility and good will to persuade them to my point of view. However with some of them it is going to get messy no matter what I do,> she said.


<So am I only going to pretend to be your boyfriend?>


<If you play your cards right maybe you won't have to do much pretending,> she sent with a smile.


<Are you sure you don’t want to go back to one of your previous boyfriends?> he asked.


<I have mostly moved on. In all it has been about 4 years since my last serious relationship if you don't count the long distance relationship I have been having with someone I have not seen physically for 5 years. For those 5 years I have been on Mars,> she sent.


<I thought things would get better on Mars. And I did make some very good friends when I first arrived. There is nothing like going through shared hell to bond with people. But once I became involved with politics it became hard to maintain contact with the old crowd. And my new friends while they were good people, they were so serious. I had never met a bunch of people who could suck the joy out of a room the way they could. Not that I blame them, they had gone through some tough times. Lately I seem be to be spending most of my time with my security detail. And fucking your security detail is less fun than you would think. It is impossible to get them to call you anything other than Sir and that is a major turn off for me. I am glad I missed their reaction when they found out I had left Mars without them. A bunch of eager puppies, the lot of them. I couldn't take them with me. Not one of them can act to save their life. There was no way that any of them could have convinced the Earth authorities that they were pro- earth refugees,> she continued.


<The big elephant in the room is my first true love, the one I cried over when they disappeared off the face of the Earth. The ones for whom I swore vengeance and retribution on those who took them from me. The one I am dreading meeting again, because they are going to expect me to still be the timid girl full of hero worship for them I was at 16. They are not going to understand I am not that person anymore.> she sent. She paused and became sad and thoughtful. After a while she continued. <Let's have a shower and breakfast then get started on your training,> she finished.


Less than an hour later Mark was clean, fed, free of extra body parts and they were standing in front of the spa. It was now filled with ice.


<You have got to be kidding,> Mark sent.


<I am afraid not. Let’s get that boot off. You should be able walk without it now. I would like to keep the splint on as the repairs to your broken arm are still fragile. However you are going to need the ice around that arm. Make sure to support that arm with your good arm.  Lie down in the ice. Don’t worry, the tarka will keep you warm.> she sent as she helped Mark into a depression in the ice then covered him up with more ice.


<This is freezing. Why am I doing this again?> he sent.


<You wanted independence and, to be less reliant on me. This requires training. We can use our tarka to run training simulations, however we will run a little hot if we do, hence the ice. Your tarka will keep your core temperature within a comfortable range. Select simulation from your internal menu. Stay in the staging area until I join you.>


Mark closed his eyes. The outside world disappeared as he entered the simulation.
