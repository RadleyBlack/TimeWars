Chapter 21 : Spongelands{b}Location{/b} : Spongelands outside Eagle City, Meridiani Planum, Mars {br}{b}Era by Mars Calendar {/b} : Sol Solis 15th Kanya MY183 {br}{b}Era by Earth Calendar {/b} : Thursday 16th March 2299CE {br}Mark watched Varija lay out her purchases on the sponge ground cover under the tree. <What is the plan?><I can’t get through to the city using the Manties' Mesh. All my messages are getting blocked. So I am creating my own node Mesh.>She used the laser cutter to cut the gossamer nano-fabric, slicing the fabric in a slanted square wave pattern. The cuts were quick and precise in a way that only someone who had been enhanced with high level Tarka could achieve. Cutting with the same pattern over and over again she produced notched strips that looked like a series of overlapping italic plus symbols. <My first plan was to use parachutes to spread the nodes. I was going to use a jerry-rigged compressed air cannon to launch them. But then I had a better idea.><What was that?><Watch and learn.> She laid the strips on top of each other, then made a series of diagonal cuts from the notches on one side to the notches on the other. She ended up with a collection of wonky, spiky ‘X’ shapes. <How did you get the strips to line so perfectly?><It is smart fabric, I told it to line up. The grid points embedded in the fabric also help with the accuracy of the cuts.>She connected a silver cylinder with a yellow dot to one leg. <Feedstock. I could have made do without it, but it makes things easier.> She connected a silver cylinder with a blue dot to one leg. <Water. Again it makes things a little easier.> She removed the sewing kit from her bag and fished out something that resembled a stapler. She used the ’stapler’ on one of the ‘X’ shapes joining the edges together until she had a sack. It was quick, and looked like using a zipper. The edges almost joined themselves. She removed a small cylinder from her leg. <A valve, I just printed it from the feedstock. A Mesh node is embedded in it.> She inserted the valve into a corner of the nano-fabric sack then used another tool from the sewing kit to seal the valve to the sack. She inserted a tube from her leg into the valve and inflated it into an octahedron that started to rise up into the air. Varija grabbed it and pushed it past the overhang of the sponge tree letting it escape into the butterscotch sky.<What did you use to use to inflate the balloons with?> Mark asked.<Hydrogen. I electrolyzed the water. However even this nano-fabric will have a hard time containing hydrogen. It’s going to leak, but they will last just long enough.>  She was already starting on the next balloon. Every fifth balloon she inflated and had him push past the overhang, releasing it to the sky. The others she stowed still deflated in her bag.<Can't you hack our way through their fire wall to the city Mesh.> <Someone's physically altered the nodes near the border. It should have been obvious from the change in communication patterns. I am not sure what would make me angrier, if no one noticed or if no one told me because they didn't want to distract me from the negotiations with Earth,> she sent.<What about a radio broadcast? Or a satellite link?><Too insecure, plus it will tell the Manties, exactly where we are,> she sent. She turned her head and displayed an animated wry smile. <I have been spending years bridging the gap between the first and second-waves. I worked so hard to improve relations and now things are worse than ever.><Why don't we just T-jump to the free corridor and hitch a ride back with the bubble farm workers.><It would be hard to come up with a believable cover story about how we got there, plus there is a lot of CCTV coverage of the corridor. If things don’t go as planned with this approach I might consider it providing we can mitigate some of the issues, but at the moment I am putting my faith in this plan.>The cable pull altered its sound. People were using it to travel. He could tell Varija had heard it too. <We are too close to the cable pull,> warned Mark.She packed up everything in her bag and they moved deeper inside the cave underneath the sponge tree. They worked their way through the twisting passages that interpenetrated the sponge forest as the walls changed from blue to green to yellow then mauve. In a few places Varija used the spike she had used on Hugo to widen the passage, in other places they had to backtrack. Finally they broke through to open air again. Varija inflated a few balloons and released them. They continued over the sponge ground cover until they reached a pipeline. After scaling one of the pylons they travelled along the pipeline for several kilometers. Varija filled and released balloons without breaking stride. All too soon however they felt the vibration of feet, not their own, striking the pipeline and they were forced to abandon it. They ventured into the sponge forest again and into the strange network of pores and channels that penetrated the sponge. They continued onwards until they came to a space that was open to the sky.Varija unpacked her bag and finished constructing her balloons,  releasing about ten as she went. <I am varying the amount of hydrogen in each balloon, which should give me a decent spread. I need to build a series of nodes that bypass the compromised nodes on the border. If possible I would like a real time link with people in the city. I am getting quite close. A lot of the nodes are reporting back on their progress.><Then what?><Extraction.><And what are you going to about the Manties?> asked Mark<Try to unruffle their feathers. Make sure they get what I promised them. Start the long process of rebuilding trust. It is going to take a long time.><What if they cut off the city?><Then the city and the sponge lands are going to be at each other’s throats. In the normal course of events a large section of the city population will have to go into suspension. Some of the Purists with low-level or mid-level Tarka will die. In the chaos some people might even go Zee. The city will have to be evacuated and the capital relocated. The government of the entire planet would be in disarray. The rescue package for the outer colonies, that I spent the last three months putting together, will be in jeopardy. If it fails, not only will tens of thousands of people die and the outer colonies be crippled, the Earth government will cast the blame on the Areos government since it was Martian independence that interrupted supply to the outer colonies in the first place,> she sent.<But you’re not going to let that happen.><Even if I transport in a few tons of ice to the bubble farms, making the city no longer dependent on the sponge lands for O{small}2{/small}, no one on either side will be in a forgiving mood. No government can afford to be held to ransom that way. Things could get ugly very quickly. No, we better fix this before the council of franchises pulls the trigger.><Couldn’t they get the numbers they need at any time? For all we know they could be voting right now,> asked Mark. <Enough talking about things we cannot change. It’s time I taught you how to fight armored foes. There is no guarantee that this extraction will be uneventful. ><I am guessing that Manties count as armored.><With this newer tougher skin, Yes,> affirmed Varija.Varija spun around slicing a section off a small sponge outcrop with something that projected out of her heel. <You are equipped with four retractable nano-blades, one in each limb. Although you can slice something as soft as sponge, the preferred attack mode for sturdier targets is a stabbing motion. The blades are generally used to deliver offensive tarka (usually either tranq, lock down or disruption tarka). They are hollow to facilitate this.> Varija demonstrated by skewering another sponge growth, it melted, eaten away from the inside.<You also have three tick launchers. One in each palm and one in your head.> She raised her hands and two more sponge shapes at the far end of the clearing melted.<Ticks are far heaver missiles than bee-stings, they are more expensive to print and you’re going to run out of feedstock for them far quicker, which is why you have only three of them as opposed to ten bee-sting launchers. Ticks can burn and drill their way through armor.> Varija sent a data stream with a list of recommended target areas for the XMEET body type, plus a list of recommended payloads for each area and how much damage to expect and how long it would take for the damage to occur. The delays were significant. Unsurprisingly the most effective way to take down a XMEET was to hit them with a nano-blade between the shoulder blades to deliver lock down tarka. Exactly how Varija took down Hugo.Varija sent a second data packet this time describing how to take down an Areos body type. <Are you expecting to fight Areos types?> asked Mark.<It is unlikely, but not impossible. A third of first-wavers have Areos bodies. However almost all of those live in the city, not the sponge lands, and if you think the ill feeling between the first and second-wavers is bad, it’s nothing to the hatred between XMEET first-wavers and Areos first-wavers. Many Manties consider the Gum-balls, as they call them, to be traitors to their own kind.>Looking through the specs for the XMEET and Areos bodies, Mark was startled by something. <Our brains are in our chests?><Of course. Where did you expect them to be?> she asked.<Makes sense. What would happen if a Himura was used on a Manty or an Areos?> Mark felt an immediate chill from Varija. <I have told you more than once you are never to fire a Himura at a human being.><Sorry to bring it up. I was just wondering what other weapons we might face in a firefight.> Mark sent defensively.<You’re unlikely to find a Himura on Mars. There is a list of the more common weapons.> Varija send him a list that mostly contained slug throwers of various calibers and some lasers. <To answer your question a Himura shell would most likely go straight through an Areos or an old style XMEET without doing any more damage than a similar sized slug. Someone with an upgraded XMEET body however would be killed instantly as their skin is just tough enough to trigger the shell’s payload. Now defend yourself, we are about to spar.>An hour later Varija finally called a halt. For most of the time, Mark tried desperately to prevent Varija ‘killing’ him. He had been hit with her palm hard enough, and frequently enough, that he was sure she had cracked something. He was equally sure that every time that he had touched her, she had let him. His body was covered in ‘paint’ rounds fired by her tick launchers. The ‘paint’ was actually his own chromophores registering her ‘hits’. Varija walked up to Mark and ‘kissed’ him. It was quite strange kissing without lips. That area of the face was soft and very sensitive, but also smooth. <Do you want to try out some of your other equipment?>They both sat on the soft spongy surface. Varija lifted Mark’s left leg and straddled his right pushing their groins together, there was a click then Mark felt a sense of freedom and something uncoiled. He flexed his cock and felt it move.<Its prehensile!> he sent. <They’re prehensile.> he sent as he looked down and he saw had more than one.<Double the fun.> He experimented, flexing, curling and twisting his two cocks.<Are you going to play with those all day or are you going to play with me?>He traced the skin of her groin with his new appendages and two lips unsealed themselves. He traced the lips with loving care.<That’s more like it.>He inserted his tips into her lips, teasing and flicking. He forced himself inside her uncoiling and straightening. She was warm and wet. He seemed to flow deeper and deeper inside her. She squeezed and milked him. She wrapped her arms around him and held him tight giving him another of those strange no lip kisses while he wiggled and twisted and squirmed inside her.Varija reached down and touched something sensitive between his two cocks. <Press this against my clit,> she commanded.Mark arched up forcing himself as far inside her as he could go. He felt himself stretched and the sensitive tip of his third cock rubbed against something wet hard and mobile. He twisted and flicked her clit, then lapped at her little nub as if it was a tongue. She tightened and squeezed around his cocks. She vibrated and rubbed around the sensitive tips of his cocks.As his orgasm crested he grabbed her hips and emptied himself explosively deep inside her. He pressed her against his body while his cocks spasmed and squirted. <I actually had alien tentacle sex. I didn’t even know that was on my bucket list,> sent Mark after the waves of his orgasm subsided.<You are making even less sense than you usually do. You know that, right,> commented Var.<Does everyone have this equipment?><They come in all shapes and sizes. I can show you a catalog if you like.><Maybe later.> They helped each other up, hugged each other and kissed. They separated reluctantly then Varija deployed more balloons and they moved out. They came out of the forest near a cable pull and travelled on it for several kilometers before Varija gave the signal to disengage. Mark rejoined Var out of view in the sponge forest.<I’ve gotten through to my team in the city. They are yelling at me, complaining about me disappearing. I am losing my patience,> explained Varija. Var let him overhear her end of the conversation.<Attention! I will hear your complaints when we are face to face, in the meantime this is the situation, the Mesh nodes on the city / sponge land border have been compromised and there is a city hostile vote being brokered in the Council of Franchises, which it is in our best interest to derail. Here are your orders.> <1. Replace those compromised nodes.><2. Put Jessy back on Manty Relations.> Varija paused. <Yes, I know what she is doing is important, but I need her on this. They will just have to do without her. And give her Martin, he should be able to help.><No more arguments! I need them shoring up the numbers on this vote. Tell them I am giving them reasonable discretion on what they can promise the council members. Tell them similar levels to the Pesaro matter.><Yes, I know we are stretched with the rescue package.><Oh! Only cutting off the O{small}2{/small} to the city.><No, we are not securing the pipeline. We are going to stop the vote in the first place.><3. I need a cover identity for one Kiro Cassidy Doyle.><Yes, I know he doesn’t exist. That’s why I need a cover identity for him. I am sending the details now.><I am vouching for him and that should be good enough for you.><It’s need to know only.><Just do it Ellen. We will discuss it later.><4. I need Havel to put together a team. I am sending the mission parameters now.><No. This doesn’t have anything to do with the Manty situation. It’s more important.><Yes. It is more important than breathing. It could solve a lot of our problems, including breathing issues.><5. I need an extraction for myself and Kiro from the sponge lands.><No. He’s not a Manty. The Rules of Engagement are, nano-blades and ticks unlocked, all XMEETs assumed to be hostile.><Yes, I know we didn’t think we would need them for a few years.><Yes, I know half the team aren’t checked out on them. Run training simulations before you deploy. You have the time.><Well that’s the advantage of using non-lethal weapons. You can say you’re sorry afterwards.><I didn’t lead with number 5, because I knew you would obsess about the extraction and forget about my other orders. Extraction will be at grid point 5F40 / 38BA in Vermilion Heptagon territory at 1500 hours.><No, don’t fly directly to our position unless we request it.><Have them fly to us if they lose contact with us.> requested Mark.<Are you actually getting properly paranoid now?> asked Varija.<It’s just Murphy’s Law,> sent Mark.<Get those nodes replaced. It will ensure we have reliable communications. If, after you have secured our communication lines, you lose contact with us for more than 10 seconds, you fly to our last known position and come in hot,> Varija sent to her team members.<Var is there anything in particular that made you choose that location?> asked Mark.<Do you want to know if someone might anticipate my choice?><Yes.><You are starting to think like someone who is being hunted. There is a possibility that my enemies could predict my choice of Vermilion Heptagon territory as it is a failed franchise. The Jeddak abdicated and immigrated to the city to spend more time with his grandchildren. Jeddaks almost never give up power and they almost never die these days. They can be deposed by a vote of no confidence, but even that is rare. Vermilion Heptagon hasn’t been able to elect a replacement as no candidate can obtain a majority. Extracting from there would cause less political problems as it exists in a sort of legal limbo,> she sent. <However Vermilion Heptagon is a large territory and assembling a force large enough to patrol it would require agreement and coordination between a number of franchises. It we did run across warriors on the way to Vermilion Heptagon, observing which colors the warriors were wearing would give us valuable information.><One day you’re going to outsmart yourself,> observed Mark.<They should give up when we take down the firewall as there will no longer be any secrets to hide. If they don’t then that tells me something useful. We will take this cable pull a couple of kilometers west to a pipeline that will get us closer to our goal.> Varija led the way to the closest pylon, climbed it, leapt and caught the cable with her handle. Mark followed and they reached the pipeline without seeing any Manties.They were several kilometers down the pipeline when Varija stopped suddenly.<What is it?> asked Mark.Varija pointed and Mark squinted, his vision zoomed in, magnifying the image several times. Crawling along the pipeline were a number of ant-like creatures.<They’re sniffers. When they across our trail, which they will do in a couple of minutes they will signal that they have found us, then follow our scent until they catch up to us. One of the reasons Manties call us stinking Earthers is that Areos have a different scent than XMEET,> warned Varija. <We need to move quickly.> She jumped off the raised pipeline without bothering to use a pylon. She ducked into a sponge pore then into a channel that led deeper into forest. Mark followed closely at her heels. She found a vertical channel or chimney and scaled it. The chimney continued for some time before opening up into the orangish-red sky. Mark and Varija scrambled out of the hole and Var fired several ticks into it. Sections of the chimney walls dissolved and flowed down into the hole.<Follow us through that why don’t you?> sent Var sounding pleased with herself. They found themselves on the top of the sponge forest. The surface was highly irregular with huge fat leaf-like structures anchored to central masts. <Oh, no!> she sent.<What now?> asked Mark. Varija indicated above them with a jerk of her head. Mark zoomed in on a dark speck soaring in the reddish sky, magnified image showed a large winged drone. Varija changed her colour to match the mauve of the surrounding leaves and Mark did the same. <Do you think it has seen us?> asked Mark. <Probably.> Varija inflated a balloon and released it, followed by another. <I have attached sensors to them. It will give us our own eyes in the sky.> then took off in a fast lope jumping from leaf to leaf. <There are 30 odd Manties travelling via spring boot closing in from the south. Five of the firewall’s nodes have been replaced so far, yet they are still coming. I am calling in the extraction team. It will take time for them to get here. We need to get under cover. Keep your eye out for another chimney.> Varija ducked under a leaf and crawled into a hole and Mark followed. The passageway was claustrophobic; several times Mark thought he was going to get stuck, then he was sliding, then falling. He managed to land on his feet in the middle of a large passage. Varija was already striding down it. Mark hurried to catch up.Varija started firing ticks. Some of the giant ant-like creatures poured in from a side passage. Mark started firing ticks as well. He could see now the ants were some kind of bot. The disruptive tarka that Mark had loaded into his ticks made short work of the bots. He still missed his Himura though. Mark jumped over the smoking remains of the bots Varija had taken out.Then they were out in the sunshine again.<Get to the other side of the clearing as quickly as possible,> sent Varija indicating a dark cave underneath the leaf-like structures of the sponge. There was a crunching sound and the sponge near Mark shook. He spun around and fired two ticks at a figure arcing though the air, it was a Manty with strange devices on his legs. Mark bent his leg to launch himself up to the Manty, but after calculating the Manty trajectory launched himself towards the hole instead. It would have taken too long to close with the Manty, he was just going to have trust the ticks to do their job. There was thump as Varija met another Manty in mid air, driving her nano-blade into their chest. Mark spun and fired ticks toward two falling figures. Then he was underneath the overhang of the sponge. After checking that Varija was following he dived into the passage, there was gun fire then they were around the bend of the passageway and heading deep into the forest.<Lime Teardrops, Blue Diamonds, Violet Hourglasses and Orange Triangles. I really thought Tony would keep out of this,> sent Var.<How long before the extraction team gets here?><About fifteen minutes.><Are there going to be enough of them to handle the Manties?> Mark asked.<They’re Areos Guard, the closest thing Mars has to Special Forces. They shouldn’t have any trouble.><Are we going to be able to keep clear of the Manties until then?><If we are captured, keep your head; they probably want hostages. They will probably dress it up, accuse us of trespassing, but they will want to forestall any direct action by the Areos government against them.  The passages became narrow and tight. The passage become so small Mark was afraid they would have to backtrack, then the passage way opened up. They came to a yellow and orange cavern with an uneven floor dotted with weird spongy shapes. It was a junction of several passages. They were half way cross the cavern when a volley of shots rang out. Bits of sponge and a sponge dust flew everywhere as slugs rained down around them. Varija staggered as she was hit. They dove for cover behind the sponge shapes.Varija shot ticks at the wall and smoke billowed out of the impact areas, further concealing them.<Are you alright?> asked Mark.<The entry and exit points are sealed,> sent Varija indicating a patch of hardening pink foam on her lower torso. <I can walk, I can shoot, I can even run as long as it is not too far. I think I should avoid any more hand to hand combat with Manties though. That passage to the left, head for it.> She grabbed something from her leg compartment and tossed it to the right. Sounds and flashes like gun fire emanated from where she had tossed the device. They made it to the side passage and tried to put as much distance between themselves and the Manties as possible.<I thought you said they would try to capture us?> complained Mark.<They are barely trained thugs, not professional soldiers. On the plus side their aim is terrible, on the negative side they could kill us by accident,> sent Var. <Another junction is coming up. Be careful.>Varija used her fingertip sensors to peer around the corners. She beckoned him, forward and indicated their next passageway.<Go!>He ran skirting a chimney that plunged though the floor. He was almost to the passageway when he heard Varija’s footsteps halt behind him. He spun around to see Varija facing a Manty that had emerged from a side passage, she leaped forward plunging one nano-blade though his neck and another nano-blade though the arm carrying his slug-thrower. Mark stepped forward to help then felt an impact in his back that threw him forward and an explosion of pain in his head. He had an image of falling towards the chimney in the floor ++++++Everything was pain and there things clamoring for his attention. There were red and yellow symbols warning him of something. The survival AI wanted to talk to him. Had he gone Zee? His organic support system was yelling at him. His bio-mech subsystem was reporting structural damage. When he tried to focus outside his body he found he was restrained. He couldn’t move, but he was being moved. Someone was carrying him over their shoulder. There was sunlight and Manty faces. An insistent message intruded into his awareness.<Induce medical coma? Yes or No?>He tried to think through the pain and the nausea. He couldn’t do anything while he was like this. He needed to heal. He told his body to repair itself as best it could and then pressed Yes.
